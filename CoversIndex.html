NOTES:

Captain Marvel (Marvel) 21 was the last for two years before Jim Starlin.
Captain America first re-appears in Avengers issue 4.
Fantastic Four 101 in 1970 = Jack Kirby's last issue.
X-Men was cancelled in March 1970 until 1975.

Without changing the issue numbers, &quot;Luke Cage Hero for Hire&quot; became &quot;Luke Cage, Power
 Man&quot;, then &quot;Power Man&quot;, then &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;.

Without changing issue numbers, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; became &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot;,
 then &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot;, then stopped after issue 15 to become &quot;Amazing Spiderman&quot;.
 They did start &quot;Amazing Spiderman&quot; with issue 1.

&quot;Nick Fury Agent of Shield&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Fury and the Howling Commandos&quot; ran
 concurently under Jim Steranko, Stan Lee, even though the stories were set in WWII and modern day.

1954 = Comics Code Authority, causing the return of superheros starting with DC Showcase issue 4 
featuring the Flash, then Marvel with Fantastic Four (1961 = seven years later?).

GOALS:
First collect some content, images and text (too much to get it all, get started with some favs).

Then make HTML pages in four cross referencing sections:
* Title: cover art and story summary. Links to Character, Artist, Publisher pages.
* Character: art and bio/origin. Art should include major changes in costume or appearence.
  Links to Title, Artist, Publisher pages.
* Artist: photo and bio. Links to Tile, Character, Publisher pages.
* Publisher: Logos, brands, mergers, owners. Links to Title, Character, Artist pages.

STRETCH GOAL:

If it grows too big and I don't burn out, put it in a database. 
Database should contain links to images, not files, to keep it fast.
The main reason for a DB is to automate the links between title, character, artist, publisher
as new content gets added. 
It could also sort things by published date or story timeline and make it easier for 
additional links like character appearances in other titles, movies, TV, toys, etc.
