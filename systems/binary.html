<b>Digital Logic</b>
<p>
The binary number system is not only the foundation of Computer Science, but also of digital electronics in general.
</p><p>
The number system we are taught in school is the decimal number system, which are sets of ten, 0 to 9. To add a value after 9, we move to the next column and start using two symbols like 10.
</p><p>
Binary does the same thing, but only has two values, 1 and 0 so when it wants to represent more than one, it moves to the next column by using two symbols like 10. This shows how you can get many values from just 1 and 0, which can be used to represent on and off states of electricity.

By using just two states in a bit, then chaining the bits together, we can represent all of the characters in the english language and all of the numbers in the decimal number system, using just 8 bits. That is all early computers could do.

The ASCII table above was the most successful type of encoding for the latin character and arabic numeral sets (text), until much later when Unicode extended ASCII to include all the character sets of the worlds major languages.

Colors and images are sent to your video card, translated using a Color Lookup Table into chroma and luminance values, then sent to your monitor. 
</p><p>
Sounds are converted into a stream of analog signals, representing the changes over time in air pressure, using the table in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in your sound card, and sent to your speakers. Audio signals picked up by a microphone does the same process in reverse, using the vibrations in the microphone to get translated into 1s and 0s.

Binary is very useful in electronics because we can turn electical power on and off very quickly using a switch. Like the dot-dash of the telegraph, or ship to ship communication using a signal lamp, computers turn power on and off quickly using transistors.
<br>
<br>
Transistors can open or close a circuit, turning power on an off like a light switch does. Instead of using your finger to flick a switch, transistors use a second power line to open or close the circuit. This second power line connects to a semiconductor material that is sandwiched between the ends of the first circuit. 
<br>
<br>
When the semiconductor gets no power, it insulates or stops the current in the first circuit. As soon as it gets power from the second circuit, it conducts or starts the first circuit again. 
<p>

Because of how the semiconductor can open or close a circuit, it is referred to as a gate.

</p><p>
Combinding these gates in particular patterns, we can represent the various states of logic from a boolean algebra table. These boolean value gates are called Logic Gates.
<br>
<br>
Combinding these Logic Gates together in specific ways we can make an adder. By connecting adders together with a carry over line, we make what is known as a full adder. Full adders are used to add binary digits (bits) together. 
</p><p>
<b>Two's Compliment (subtraction)</b>
<br>
The two's complement of a binary number takes half the bits and treats them like negative values. Using this method, we can use a Full Adder circuit on negative numbers giving us subtraction. Addition in sets = multiplication and subtraction in sets = division,  a full set of arithmatic.
