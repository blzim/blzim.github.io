<b>Motherboards</b>
</p><p>
The main printed circuit board (PCB) in an electronic device, sometimes called a "mainboard". It contains sockets that accept additional circuit boards called expansion cards. In a personal computer, the motherboard contains the bus, CPU, any co-processors, memory sockets, keyboard controller and supporting chips sometimes called "chipset". Many chipset features have been integrated into the CPU over the years.

Desktops

The IBM AT (Advanced Technology) motherboard that dominated PCs in the 1970s through the 90s, is quickly recognized by the power socket, used to connect two 6 pin power supply connections. Get the power plugged in backwards and poof, dead system! Old guys remembered "black to black" putting the black wires together in the center of the power socket to avoid the expensive damage so easily done. 
</p><p>
The main feature or new idea of this PCB is it allows for 3rd party hardware to expand the system features. It was a very BIG industry changing idea when it came out.

ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended) motherboards started in 90â€™s and are still available. The ATX connector on the motherboard consists of a much safer single ATX power supply connector, notched to prevent plugging in the wrong way. These boards are used for Pentium 2, 3 or 4 processors, useful past the year 2000.

BTX (for Balanced Technology eXtended) is a form factor for motherboards, originally intended to be the replacement for the aging ATX motherboard form factor in late 2004 and early 2005, but didn't sell well. Around this time desktop sales dramatically dropped in favor of laptops, smartphones, and tiny Next Unit of Computing (NUC) hand sized desktops.

EATX (Extended ATX) as of 2018 is the current large for high end "gaming" motherboard. It requires and EATX case as well.

WTX (Workstation Technology eXtended) was a motherboard form factor specification introduced by Intel at the IDF in September 1998, for its use at high-end, multiprocessor, multiple-hard-disk servers and workstations.

Laptops
</p><p>
Below is a laptop motherboard. Laptops motherboards are smaller, have more built-in device circuits with few, if any, expansion slots. They are mostly custom made to fit the chassis model or family of models they are released with.

SBC or Mobile Device
</p><p>
A Single Board Computer is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, with microprocessor(s), memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers range from development systems, educational systems, or for use as cell phones or embedded computer controllers.

Unlike a desktop personal computer, single board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for peripheral functions or expansion. Single board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors. Simple designs, such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use static RAM and low-cost 8 or 16 bit processors. Other types, such as blade servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a more compact format.
