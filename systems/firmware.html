Firmware
<p>
Firmware is hardware instruction code that is stored on non volitile memory in an integrated circuit or "chip". For this reason it is often referred to as chip code.
</p><p>
The most important firmware in a computer system in the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). The BIOS is used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.
</p><p>
BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a the system board, it is the first software run when powered on. It can usually be updated but requires a special software "flash" tool provided by the manufacturer to do so. The most popular BIOS companies as of 2018 are American Megatrends Inc (AMI) and AWARD.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the successor to BIOS, performing the same tasks in new ways.
</p><p>
Both legacy BIOS and UEFI provide a "System Startup" tool that allows a user to change some of their settings. Settings vary from system to system, but one of the most commonly used setting is the boot order. 
<p>
The Boot order allows you to choose which storage device will boot the OS. This has become a very handy alternative way to boot your system with a different operating system. Software bootloaders used to be the preferred method, but they are prone to getting replaced. 
<p>
Windows system updates will often replace the software boot loader, wiping any secondary boot options like Linux bootup. To avoid this from re-occuring, many dual boot users now install Windows and Linux on separate disks, each disk with their own software boot loader, which will not get over written by updates.
<p>
When they want to boot into another OS, they simply select a disk from this lower level hardware boot loader.

<p>
With devices that have only one disk, like small laptops, alternatives exist such as running your OS in a virtual environment, or from a USB boot stick.
<p>
If your system includes adapters like a hardware RAID controller or SAS host bus adapter, you will also see those peripherial BIOS systems load after the system BIOS. These peripherials may include startup interfaces of their own. This is most common with server hardware.
</p><p>
Flashing
</p><p>
Writing firmware is called "Flashing" and may involve the overwriting of existing firmware or data, contained in EEPROM or flash memory modules present in an electronic device, with new data.
</p><p>
This can be done to upgrade a device or to change the provider of a service associated with the function of the device, such as changing from one mobile phone service provider to another or installing a new operating system. 
</p><p>
If firmware is upgradable, it is often done via a program from the provider, and will often allow the old firmware to be saved before upgrading so it can be reverted to if the process fails, or if the newer version performs worse. This is case with most computer BIOS firmware.
</p><p>
In other cases an electronic device will allow firmware updates to happen with a workstation and a serial connection (like USB) to a debug port interface (DPI) like in the image below.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Similar types of interfaces include I2C, SPI, SMBus, GPIO, etc, most of which can be adapted to work in a USB port and allow you to read and write with the right software.
</p><p>

</p><p>
In cases where you cannot flash firmware within the system, or connect a workstation to a port, you can desolder the chip from the PCB and plug it into a chip programmer.
</p><p>
A chip programmer allows you to connect your chip to a workstation, usually through a USB connection, and read and write code to and from the chip, with the specially designed software that comes with the programmer interface.
</p><p>

</p><p>
A Universal Chip Programmer usually has options to purchase additional adapter modules that will talk to chips that don't fit directly into the device, such as surface mount ICs.
