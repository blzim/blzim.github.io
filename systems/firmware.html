<h1>Firmware</h1>

<p>Firmware is hardware instruction code that is stored on non volitile memory in an integrated circuit or "chip". For this reason it is often referred to as chip code.</p>

<p>The most important firmware in a computer system in the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). The BIOS is used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.</p>

<p>BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a the system board, it is the first software run when powered on. It can usually be updated but requires a special software "flash" tool provided by the manufacturer to do so. The most popular BIOS companies as of 2018 are American Megatrends Inc (AMI) and AWARD.</p>

<p>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the successor to BIOS, performing the same tasks in new ways.</p>

<p>Both legacy BIOS and UEFI provide a "System Startup" tool that allows a user to change some of their settings. Settings vary from system to system, one of the most important pieces is the boot order. The Boot order allows you to choose which storage device will boot the OS.</p>

<p>If your system includes adapters like a hardware RAID controller or SAS host bus adapter, you will also see those peripherial BIOS systems load after the system BIOS. These peripherials may include startup interfaces of their own. This is most common with server hardware.</p>
