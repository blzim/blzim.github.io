<p><b>The Bus</b><br />
<br />
Although Computer Buses are broken into two types, local and peripheral, they both 
perform the same function, to create a common pathway, or channel, between multiple devices. 
</p>

<p>The computer's internal bus is known as the local bus, or processor bus. It provides a parallel data transfer 
path between the CPU and main memory and to the peripheral buses. Peripheral Buses are expansion boards 
(cards, adapters, etc.)that plug into the computer's bus. Signals and data pass between the peripheral device and 
memory. A 16-bit bus transfers two bytes at a time over 16 wires; a 32-bit bus uses 32 wires, etc. The bus is comprised 
of two parts: the address bus and the data bus. Addresses are sent over the address bus to signal a memory location, and 
the data is transferred over the data bus to that location. Various buses have been used in the PC, including the 
ISA, EISA, Micro Channel, VL-bus and PCI bus. Less common peripheral buses are NuBus, TURBOchannel, VMEbus, 
MULTIBUS and STD bus.
</p>

<p><b>Popular Peripheral Buses:</b></p>
<p>
<b>ISA</b> (Industry Standard Architecture) <br /> 
Pronounced "eye-suh." An expansion bus commonly used in PCs. It accepts the plug-in boards that control the
video display, disks and other peripherals. Most PCs today use the ISA and PCI buses and have a combination of 
ISA and PCI slots.</p>


<p><b>PCI</b>(Peripheral Component Interconnect)<br />
A peripheral bus commonly used in PC. It was designed primarily by Intel and first appeared on PCs in late 1993. 
PCI provides a high-speed data path between the CPU and peripheral devices (video, disk, network, etc.). 
There are typically three or four PCI slots on the motherboard. In a Pentium PC, there is generally a mix of PCI 
and ISA slots or PCI and EISA slots. Early on, the PCI bus was known as a "local bus."</p>
<p>
PCI runs at 33MHz, supports 32- and 64-bit data paths and bus mastering. The number of peripheral devices the 
bus can handle is based on loads, which have to do with inductance, capacitance and other electrical characteristics. 
Normally there are 10 loads per bus. The PCI chipset uses three, leaving seven for peripherals. Controllers built onto 
the motherboard use one load, whereas controllers that plug into an expansion slot use 1.5 loads.</p>
<p>
PCI provides "plug and play" capability, automatically configuring the PCI cards at startup. When PCI is used with 
the ISA bus, the only thing that is generally required is to indicate in the CMOS memory which IRQs are already in use 
by ISA cards. PCI takes care of the rest. PCI allows IRQs to be shared, which helps to solve the problem of limited IRQs 
available on a PC. For example, if there were only one IRQ left over after ISA devices were given their required IRQs, 
all PCI devices could share it. In a PCI-only machine, there cannot be insufficient IRQs, as all can be shared.</p>

Except for ISA and AGP, all the other boards in this illustration have given way to PCI. 
Although most PC motherboards still have ISA slots, they too will give way to PCI. The PCI bus provides a wider 
bandwidth than the traditional ISA bus, allowing peripherals to transfer data at higher speed. Portable computers 
like Laptops use a card bus in place of PCI. </p>

<b>PCMCIA or PC CARD</b><br />
PCMCIA stands for Personal Computer Memory Card International Association 
An international standards body and trade association that was founded in 1989 to establish a standard for connecting 
peripherals to portable computers or LAPTOPS. The PC Card is a credit-card sized, removable module for portable 
computers standardized by PCMCIA. PC Cards are also known as "PCMCIA cards." PC Cards are 16-bit devices that are used 
to attach modems, network adapters, sound cards, radio transceivers, solid state disks and hard disks to a portable computer.
The PC Card is a "plug and play" device, which is configured automatically by the Card Services software.</p>

<p>All PC Cards are 85.6 mm long by 54 mm wide (3.37"x 2.126") and use a 68-pin connector.<br /></p>

<IMG SRC="Image11.gif"></p>

<p>The original Type I card is 3.3 mm thick and is typically used to hold memory.<br />
Type II cards (5.0 mm thick) are commonly used for memory, modems and LAN adapters in laptops.
<br />Type III cards (10.5 mm thick) are used to hold a hard disk, wireless transceiver or other peripheral that needs 
more space. 
<br />The Type III slot can hold two Type II cards. Toshiba introduced a 16 mm Type IV card, but this has not been 
officially adopted by the PCMCIA. Smaller cards will work in a Type IV slot.

<p><B>CardBus</B><br />
In early 1995, PCMCIA introduced the 32-bit CardBus standard. Although electrically different, the CardBus is 
architecturally identical to the PCI bus. The CardBus supports bus mastering and accommodates cards operating at 
different voltages. Its advanced power management features allows the computer to take advantage of CardBus cards 
designed to idle or turn off in order to increase battery life. The CardBus specification allows data transfer up to 
132 Mbytes/sec over a 33MHz, 32-bit data path.</p>

<B><p>Card and Socket Services</B><br />
In order to use a PC Card slot in the computer, Card and Socket services must be loaded, typically at system startup. 
Card and Socket Services software is generally included with laptops that have PC Card slots. It also comes packaged 
with PC Cards. Card Services manage system resources required by the PC Card, and, on PCs, determines which IRQs and 
memory and I/O addresses are assigned. They also manage hot swapping and pass changes in events to higher-level drivers 
written for specific cards.</FONT>

<p><B>USB </B><br />
(Universal Serial Bus) A hardware interface for low-speed peripherals such as the keyboard, 
mouse, joystick, scanner, printer and telephony devices. It also supports MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 digital video. USB has a 
maximum bandwidth of 1.5 Mbytes/sec, and up to 127 devices can be attached. Peripherals can be plugged in and unplugged 
without turning the system off. USB ports began to appear on PCs in 1997, and Windows 98 fully supports it.
The devices are plugged directly into a four-pin USB socket on the PC or into a multi-port hub that plugs into the PC or 
into a device that also functions as a hub for other devices. USB ports on the PC and hubs use a rectangular Type A socket. 
All cables that are permanently attached to the device have a Type A plug.Devices that use a separate cable have a square 
Type B socket, and the cable that connects them has both a Type A and a Type B plug.</p>

The thin, rectangular A connectors are on the PC and hub. 
Type B connectors are used on peripherals that have cables which are not permanently attached.</p>

<p>USB connections resolve installation conflicts, with a standard software system called PnP (Plug and Play) developed by IBM and Microsoft in the 1990s. Now users no longer have to manually assign settings like IRQs.</p>
