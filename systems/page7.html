<p><b>Keyboards</b><br />
There are few compatibility problems with PC keyboards. 
Most work well on all desktop PCs and as an alternate laptop keyboard with a USB bus connection. Older keyboards may have a manual 
XT-AT switch that changes internal electronics from the first PC keyboard used with XTs to the later AT 
and subsequent keyboards. Keyboards plug into either a 5-pin DIN or a 6-pin mini-DIN socket on the motherboard. 
Adapters connect a 5-pin plug to a 6-pin socket.</p>

<b>Key names </b> - Each symbol key on a keyboard has a specific name. Some symbol key names are listed:
<br />
<b>:   </b> = colon <br />
<b>;   </b> = semi colon <br />
<b>\   </b> = backslash <br />
<b>/   </b>= forwardslash <br />
<b>|   </b> = pipe (shift + \)<br />
<b>~   </b> = tilde <br />
<b>[ ] </b> brackets <br />
<b>{}  </b> curly brackets <br />
<b> _  </b> underscore (shift + hyphen)<br />
<b> @  </b> ampersand <br />
<b>#   </b> hash or pound <br />
<b>^   </b> karat <br />
<b>()  </b>parenthises</p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Mouse</b><br />
The most popular pointing device. It was called a mouse because it more or less resembled one, 
with the cord being the mouse's tail. Mice used to connect to a serial port via a 9-pin DB, now almost all 
mice have a PS/2 connector. (USB is catching on, and may replace PS/2 Mice soon).</p>
