</p><p>
<a name="Actionscript"></a>
Actionscript<br>
The object oriented programming language used by Macromedia's Flash product. Flash 
is a proprietary plaform for producing animations or basic video games. 
It is most commonly seen creating animations for web pages. ActionScript was created by
Gary Gossman, the Principal Engineer for the Macromedia Flash Team.
</p><p>
<a name="Ada"></a>
Ada<br>
A high-level programming language developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s for the 
United States Defense Department. Ada was designed to be a general-purpose language for 
everything from business applications to rocket guidance systems. One of its principal 
features is that it supports real-time applications. In addition, Ada incorporates modular 
techniques that make it easier to build and maintain large systems. Since 1986, Ada has 
been the mandatory development language for most U.S. military applications. In addition, 
Ada is often the language of choice for large systems that require real-time processing, 
such as banking and air traffic control systems.
</p><p>
Ada is named after Augusta Ada Byron (1815-52), daughter of Lord Byron, and Countess of 
Lovelace. She helped Charles Babbage develop programs for the analytic engine, the first 
mechanical computer. She is considered by many to be the world's first programmer. 
</p><p>
<a name="Awk"></a>
Awk
</p><p>
An interpreted programming language that is included in most versions of UNIX. 
The name is derived from the initials of its creators -- Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, 
and Brian Kernighan -- who developed the language in 1977 and 1978. The language is 
particularly designed for filtering and manipulating textual data. In this respect, 
it is similar to Perl, though Perl is more powerful. There are many variants of awk, including gawk, which is the GNU version. 
</p><p>
<a name="Bash"></a>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html">Bash</a>
</p><p>
Bourne Again Shell is an sh-compatable shell, or command language interpreter, that 
incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It offers 
functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, 
most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.  Bash is the default Linux shell.
</p><p>
The improvements offered by BASH include:
<ul>
<li>Command line editing
<li>Unlimited size command history
<li>Job Control
<li>Shell Functions and Aliases
<li>Indexed arrays of unlimited size
<li>Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four 
</ul>
</p><p>
<a name="Basic"></a>
Basic
</p><p>
Acronym for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. Developed by John Kemeney 
and Thomas Kurtz in the mid 1960s at Dartmouth College, BASIC is one of the earliest and 
simplest high-level programming languages. During the 1970s, it was the principal 
programming language taught to students, and continues to be a popular choice among educators.
</p><p>
Despite its simplicity, BASIC is used for a wide variety of business applications. There is 
an ANSI standard for the BASIC language, but most versions of BASIC include many proprietary 
extensions. Microsoft's popular Visual Basic, for example, adds many object-oriented features 
to the standard BASIC.
</p><p>
Recently, many variations of BASIC have appeared as programming, or macro, languages within 
applications. For example, Microsoft Word and Excel both come with a version of BASIC with 
which users can write programs to customize and automate these applications.
</p><p>
<a name = "C"></a>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/" target="_blank">C</a>
</p><p>
A high-level compiled programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the 
mid 1970s.
</p><p>
There are some variation of C that floated around in the past, but ISO C is the international standard for the C programming language, and the one most commonly found today (as of 2018).
</p><p>
Although originally designed as a systems programming language, C has proved to be a powerful 
and flexible language that can be used for a variety of applications, from business programs 
to engineering. C is a particularly popular language for personal computer programmers because 
it is relatively small, it requires less memory than other languages.
</p><p>
The first major program written in C was the UNIX operating system, and for many years C was 
considered to be inextricably linked with UNIX. Now, however, C is an important language 
independent of UNIX.
</p><p>
The Linux operating system is also written in C, as is most of Windows and Mac OS, to name a few.
</p><p>
Although it is a high-level language, C is much closer to assembly language than are most 
other high-level languages. This closeness to the underlying machine language allows C 
programmers to write very efficient code. The low-level nature of C, however, can make the 
language difficult to use for some types of applications or some types of programmers.
</p><p>
<a name="C#"></a>
C#
</p><p>
Pronounced "see-sharp." A hybrid of C and C++, it is a Microsoft programming language 
developed to compete with Sun's Java language. C# is an object-oriented programming 
language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform and designed for improving 
productivity in the development of Web applications. C# boasts type-safety, garbage 
collection, simplified type declarations, versioning and scalability support, and other 
features that make developing solutions faster and easier, especially for COM+ and Web 
services. Microsoft critics (and a Sun lawsuit against Microsoft) have pointed to 
the similarities between C# and Java.
</p><p>
<a name="C++"></a>
C++ 
</p><p>
A high-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. 
C++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C++ is one of the most popular 
programming language for graphical applications, such as those that run in Windows and 
Macintosh environments.
</p><p>
<a name="Clipper"></a>
Clipper
</p><p>
The official moniker is CA-Clipper. This is just as well since the US Government and 
its contractors have appropriated the name "Clipper" to apply to an encryption scheme 
that has nothing to do with this programming language.
</p><p>
Clipper is a programming language, and it is also a compiler. The programming language 
is a superset of dBASE III+, and also shares some features with C/C++ and Smalltalk. 
It is a general-purpose, high-level programming language well suited to corporate and 
commercial applications development.
</p><p>
CA-Clipper is also a compiler product marketed by Computer Associates, the second 
largest software vendor in the world today. The CA-Clipper compiler is (by definition) 
a fully conformant implementation of the CA-Clipper programming language for IBM-PC-type 
personal computers running DOS-like operating systems.
</p><p>
There are other Clipper implementations, from vendors other than Computer Associates, 
that have varying capabilities and run on platforms other than MS-DOS, but as a whole,
clipper is pretty much out dated.
</p><p>
<a name="COBOL"></a>
COBOL
</p><p>
Acronym for common business oriented language. Developed in the late 1950s and early 
1960s, COBOL is the second-oldest high-level programming language (FORTRAN is the oldest). 
It is particularly popular for business applications that run on large computers.
</p><p>
COBOL is a wordy language; programs written in COBOL tend to be much longer than the same 
programs written in other languages. This can be annoying when you program in COBOL, but 
the wordiness makes it easy to understand programs because everything is spelled out. 
Although disparaged by many programmers for being outdated, COBOL is still the most widely 
used programming language in the world. 
</p><p>
<a name="Csh/tcsh"></a>
Csh/tcsh
</p><p>
C shell (csh) and an enhanced C shell (tcsh) Are shell languages.
A shell is a command interpreter. You type commands into a shell, and the shell passes 
them to the computer for execution. 
</p><p>
UNIX systems usually provide several shell choices. 
C shell (csh), a popular command interpreter that has its origins in Berkeley UNIX, is 
particularly suited for interactive use. It offers many features, including an ability 
to recall and modify previous commands, a facility for creating command shortcuts, 
shorthand notation for pathnames to home directories, and job control.
</p><p>
tcsh, an enhanced version of csh, is almost entirely upward compatible with csh, so 
whatever you know about the C shell you can apply immediately to tcsh. But tcsh goes 
beyond csh, adding capabilities like a general purpose command line editor, spelling 
correction, and programmable command, file, and user name completion.
</p><p>
Shells other than csh and tcsh may be available on a UNIX  or Linux system. 
The two most significant examples are the Bourne shell (sh) and the Korn shell (ksh). 
The Bourne shell is the oldest of the currently popular shells and is the most widely 
available. The Korn shell was developed at AT&amp;T and is most prevalent on System V-based 
UNIX systems.  BASH, the Bourne  Again SHell is the default shell for most Linux systems.
</p><p>
<a name="curl"></a>
Curl
</p><p>
Curl is a new language for creating web documents with almost any sort of content, from simple formatted 
text to complex interactive applets. Curl provides a rich set of formatting operations similar to those
implemented by HTML tags. Unlike HTML, the Curl formatter can be extended by users to provide 
additional functionality, from simple macros (e.g., to provide a convenient way to switch to a particular
font, size and color) to direct control over the positioning of subcomponents (e.g., as in a TeX-like 
equation formatter). Several packages of useful formatting extensions are currently under development.
</p><p>
Using a TK-like interface toolkit of interactive components, Curl makes it easy to build simple 
interactive web pages. One can view interactive objects like buttons or editable fields as extensions 
to the basic formatting operations provided above -- one uses the same easy-to-learn syntax to create 
interactive documents as to create regular text documents. There's no need to learn a separate scripting 
language.
</p><p>
<a name="D"></a>
<a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/">D</a>
</p><p>
D is a general purpose systems and applications programming language. It is a higher level language 
 than C++, but retains the ability to write high performance code and interface directly with the operating 
 system API's and with hardware. D is well suited to writing medium to large scale million line programs 
 with teams of developers. D is easy to learn, provides many capabilities to aid the programmer, and is 
 well suited to aggressive compiler optimization technology.
</p><p>
D is compiled with GCC, not a scripting language, nor an interpreted language. It doesn't come with a VM, a religion, or an 
overriding philosophy. It's a practical language for practical programmers who need to get the job done 
quickly, reliably, and leave behind maintainable, easy to understand code.
</p><p>
D is the culmination of decades of experience implementing compilers for many diverse languages, and 
attempting to construct large projects using those languages. D draws inspiration from those other languages 
(most especially C++) and tempers it with experience and real world practicality.
</p><p>
<a name="Dylan"></a>
<a href="http://www.gwydiondylan.org/">Dylan</a>
</p><p>
Dylan is an advanced, object-oriented, dynamic language which supports the rapid development of 
programs. When needed, the programmer can later optimize [his or her] programs for more efficient 
execution by supplying type information to the compiler. Nearly all entities in Dylan (including functions, 
classes, and basic data types such as integers) are first class objects. Additionally Dylan supports
multiple inheritance, polymorphism, multiple dispatch, keyword arguments, object introspection, and 
many other advanced features.
</p><p>
Dylan is fast, flexible and capable of unusually sophisticated abstractions. Some of its more interesting 
features include:
<ul>
<li>An advanced object model. Dylan's object model is more powerful than those of most mainstream languages, but more familiar than what you'd find in an academic language.
<li>Efficiency and flexibility. Dylan can be used as a dynamic prototyping language (like Smalltalk) or an efficient compiled language. Functional Developer, Functional Objects' Dylan compiler, generates code as good as that of most C compilers. Still, it provides an interactive prototyping environment like those found in Smalltalk or Common Lisp.
<li>Support for advanced IDEs. The original implementation of Dylan stored code in a database and provided multiple views of how definitions were related. Cross-referencing, hypercode and online documentation were all popular research topics among the language's designers.
<li>Infix syntax. (Most languages, including C, are infix. LISP is prefix and Forth is postfix.) 
</ul>
</p><p>
<a name="Eiffel"></a>
Eiffel
</p><p>
An advanced programming language created by Bertrand Meyer and developed by his company, 
Interactive Software Engineering (ISE). The language was introduced in 1986 and a basic Windows 
compiler is available at no charge.
</p><p>
Eiffel encourages object-oriented program development and supports a systematic approach to software 
development. The Eiffel compiler generates C code, which you can then modify and re-compile with a 
C compiler.
</p><p>
<a name="Erlang"></a>
Erlang
</p><p>
Erlang is a general-purpose programming language and runtime environment. 
Erlang has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. 
Erlang is used in several large telecommunication systems from Ericsson. 
The most popular implementation of Erlang is available as open source from the open 
source erlang site.
</p><p>
OTP is a large collection of libraries for Erlang to do everything from compiling ASN.1 
to providing a WWW server. Most projects using "Erlang" are actually using "Erlang/OTP", 
i.e. the language and the libraries. OTP is also open source.
</p><p>
Erlang particularly suitable for distributed, reliable, soft real-time concurrent systems.
Telecomms systems, e.g. controlling a switch or converting protocols.
Servers for Internet applications, e.g. a mail transfer agent, an IMAP-4 server, an HTTP 
server or a WAP Stack.Telecomms applications, e.g. handling mobility in a mobile network or providing unified 
messaging. Database applications which require soft realtime behaviour. 
Erlang is good at solving these sorts of problems because this is the problem domain it 
was originally designed for. Stating the above in terms of features:
<ul>
<li>Erlang provides a simple and powerful model for error containment and fault tolerance (supervised processes).
<li>Concurrency and message passing are a fundamental to the language.
<li>Applications written in Erlang are often composed of hundreds or thousands of lightweight processes.Context switching between Erlang processes is typically one or two orders of magnitude cheaper than switching between threads in a C program.
<li>Writing applications which are made of parts which execute on different machines (i.e. distributed applications) is easy. Erlang's distribution mechanisms are transparent: programs need not be aware that they are distributed.
<li>The OTP libraries provide support for many common problems in networking      and telecommunications systems.
<li>The Erlang runtime environment (a virtual machine, much like the Java virtual machine) means code compiled on one architecture runs anywhere. 
<li>The runtime system also allows code in a running system to be updated without interrupting the program. 
</ul>
</p><p>
<a name="Felix"></a>
<a href="http://felix.sourceforge.net/">Felix</a>
</p><p>
A high power, Open Source, community based programming language which provides an ML 
style type system with a syntax that C++ programmers should find easy to learn. 
It generates C++ and supports both use of C++ types as primitives, as well as embedding 
in existing C++ written architectures in a natural manner.
</p><p>
Unlike many other scripting languages, Felix boasts seamless integration with C and C++ 
code bases, which it achieves by adopting the C/C++ object model directly. 
</p><p>
<a name="Forth"></a>
Forth
</p><p>
Forth is an interactive programming environment originally designed for programmers 
developing applications using mini- and micro-computers. Its primary uses have been 
in scientific and industrial application such as instrumentation, robotics, process 
control, graphics and image processing, artificial intelligence and business applications. 
The principal advantage of Forth include rapid, interactive software development and 
efficient use of computer hardware.
</p><p>
Forth is often spoken of as a language because that is its most visible aspect. However, 
Forth is more than a conventional programming language in that all the capabilities 
normally associated with a large portfolio of separate programs (compilers, editors, 
assemblers, etc.) are included within its range. It is also less than a conventional 
programming language in its deliberate lack of complex syntax characteristic of most 
high-level languages.
</p><p>
The original implementations of Forth were stand-alone systems that included functions 
normally performed by separate operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers, debuggers 
and other utilities. A single, simple, consistent set of rules governed this range of 
capabilities. Today, although very fast stand-alone version are sill marketed for many 
processors, there are also many versions that run co-resident with conventional operating 
systems, such as MS-DOS and Unix.
</p><p>
Forth was not derived from another language. As a result, its appearance and internal 
characteristics may seem unfamiliar to new users. But Forth's simplicity, extreme modularity, 
and interactive nature offset the initial strangeness, making it easy to learn and use. 
A new Forth programmer must invest some time mastering its large command repertoire. 
After a month or so of full-time use, the programmer could understand more of its internal 
working than is possible with conventions operating systems and compilers.
</p><p>
The most unconventional feature of Forth is its extensibility. The programming process in 
Forth consists of defining new words, actually new commands in the language. These may be 
defined in terms of previously defined words, much as one teaches a child concepts by 
explaining them in terms of previously understood concepts. Such words are called "high 
level definitions." Alternatively, new words may also be defined in assembly code, since 
most Forth implementations include an assembler for the host processor.
</p><p>
As a result of this extensibility, developing an application has the collateral result 
of developing a special "application-oriented language" for that type of application 
which may be applied to a similar application or used to modify this one. 
</p><p>
<a name="Fortran"></a>
Fortran
</p><p>
Acronym for formula translator, FORTRAN is the oldest high-level programming language. 
Designed by John Backus for IBM in the late 1950s, it is still popular today, particularly 
for scientific applications that require extensive mathematical computations.
</p><p>
<a name="Groovy"></a>
<a href="http://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a>
</p><p>
Groovy is a new agile dynamic language for the JVM combining lots of great features 
from languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk and making them available to the Java 
developers using a Java-like syntax.
</p><p>
Groovy is designed to help you get things done on the Java platform in a quicker, 
more concise and fun way - bringing the power of Python and Ruby inside the Java platform.
Groovy can be used as an alternative compiler to javac to generate standard Java 
bytecode to be used by any Java project or it can be used dynamically as an 
alternative language such as for scripting Java objects, templating or writing 
unit test cases.
</p><p>
<a name="Haskell"></a>
Haskell<br>
Haskell is a computer programming language. In particular, it is a  polymorphicly typed, lazy, purely 
functional  language, quite different from most other programming languages. The language is named 
for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a foundation for functional 
languages. Haskell is based on lambda calculus.
</p><p>
Haskell is a wide-spectrum language, suitable for a variety of applications. It is particularly 
suitable for programs which need to be highly modifiable and maintainable.
Much of a software product's life is spent in specification, design and maintenance, and not 
in programming. Functional languages are superb for writing specifications which can actually be
executed (and hence tested and debugged). Such a specification then is the first prototype of the 
final program. Functional programs are also relatively easy to maintain, because the code is shorter, clearer, and the 
rigorous control of side effects eliminates a huge class of unforseen interactions.
</p><p>
What is functional programming? C, Java, Pascal, Ada, and so on, are all imperative languages. 
They are "imperative" in the sense that they consist of a sequence of commands, which are executed 
strictly one after the other. Haskell is a functional language. A functional program is a single 
expression, which is executed by evaluating the expression. Anyone who has used a spreadsheet has 
experience of functional programming. In a spreadsheet, one specifies the value of each cell in terms 
of the values of other cells. The focus is on what is to be computed, not how it should be computed.
</p><p>

<a name="Icon"></a>
Icon	<br>
Icon is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with a large repertoire of 
features for processing data structures and character strings. Icon is an imperative, 
procedural language with a syntax reminiscent of C and Pascal, but with semantics at a 
much higher level.
</p><p>

<a name="Java"></a>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a>
<br>
A high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. <br>
Java was originally called OAK, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. 
Oak was unsuccessful so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to 
take advantage of the burgeoning World Wide Web.
</p><p>
Java is an object-oriented language similar to C++, but simplified to eliminate language 
features that cause common programming errors. Java source code files (files with a .java 
extension) are compiled into a format called bytecode (files with a .class extension), which 
can then be executed by a Java interpreter. Compiled Java code can run on most computers 
because Java interpreters and runtime environments, known as Java Virtual Machines (VMs), 
exist for most operating systems, including UNIX, the Macintosh OS, and Windows. Bytecode 
can also be converted directly into machine language instructions by a just-in-time compiler 
(JIT).
</p><p>
Java is a general purpose programming language with a number of features that make the 
language well suited for use on the World Wide Web. Small Java applications are called 
Java applets and can be downloaded from a Web server and run on your computer by a 
Java-compatible Web browser, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. 
</p><p>

<a name="JavaScript"></a>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> <br>
A scripting language developed by Netscape to enable Web authors to design interactive 
sites. Although it shares many of the features and structures of the full Java language, 
it was developed independently. Javascript can interact with HTML source code, enabling 
Web authors to spice up their sites with dynamic content. In 2009 with the Node.js runtime environment, javascript can now be used as both client side and server side programming.
</p><p>

<a name="Jython"></a>
<a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>
<br>
Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented language Python 
written in 100% Pure Java, and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus 
allows you to run Python on any Java platform.
</p><p>

<a name="LabView"></a>
LabView<br>	
LabVIEW is a fully featured programming language produced by National Instruments. 
It is a graphical language quite unique in the method by which code is constructed 
and saved. There is no text based code as such, but a diagrammatic view of how the 
data flows through the program. Thus LabVIEW is a much loved tool of the scientist 
and engineer who can often visualise data flow rather than how a text based conventional 
programming language must be built to achieve a task.
</p><p>

<a name="Lingo"></a>
<a href="http://www.lingolanguage.com/">Lingo</a>
<br>
Lingo makes it easy to learn to program for Windows. If you're new to programming, 
you can download Lingo and write your first program very easily. And experienced 
programmers benefit because Lingo is quick to install and simple to use! Lingo 
includes a Developer Environment for designing forms, managing projects and debugging.
</p><p>
    * Lingo is a compilable high level language (like Eiffel, C, C++, Ada, Java, C#, Delphi).<br>
    * Lingo produces native Windows EXE files (like Eiffel, C, C++, Ada and Delphi).<br>
    * Lingo is fully integrated with program management tools and dialog layout editors (like VB5, C# and Delphi).<br>
    * Lingo has fully automatic memory management (like VB5, C# and Java).<br>
    * Lingo has safety features and pre and post conditions (like Eiffel).<br>
    * Lingo has high-level data types such as resizable arrays, lists and tables (like VB5 and Java).<br>
    * Lingo can read and write most file types, including text, binary, CSV, XML and dBase.<br>
    * Lingo programs use graphical objects (buttons, edit fields etc) that work properly under all versions of Windows.
</p><p>

<a name="Lisp"></a>
Lisp 	<br>
Acronym for list processor, a high-level programming language especially popular for 
artificial intelligence applications. LISP was developed in the early 1960s by John 
McCarthy at MIT.
</p><p>

<a name="Logo"></a>
Logo	<br>
The Logo Programming Language, a dialect of Lisp, was designed as a tool for learning.
The most popular Logo environments have involved the Turtle, originally a robotic 
creature that sat on the floor and could be directed to move around by typing commands 
at the computer. Soon the Turtle migrated to the computer graphics screen where it is 
used to draw shapes, designs, and pictures.
</p><p>
Although there are some versions of Logo that compile, it is generally implemented 
as an interpreted language.
</p><p>
In the mid 1960s Seymour Papert, a mathematician who had been working with Piaget in 
Geneva, came to the United States where he co-founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory with  Marvin Minsky. Papert worked with the team from Bolt, Beranek and 
Newman, led by Wallace Feurzeig, that created the first version of Logo in 1967.
</p><p>
<a name="Lua"></a>
<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>
<br>
Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. 
Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software.
Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on 
associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, 
and has automatic memory management with garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, 
scripting, and rapid prototyping.
</p><p>
A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms for implementing features, 
instead of providing a host of features directly in the language. For example, although Lua is not a pure 
object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for implementing classes and inheritance. 
Lua's meta-mechanisms bring an economy of concepts and keep the language small, while allowing the 
semantics to be extended in unconventional ways. Extensible semantics is a distinguishing feature of Lua.
</p><p>
Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application. This means that, besides syntax and 
semantics, Lua has an API that allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also to 
extend Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded as a language framework for building 
domain-specific languages.
</p><p>
Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all 
known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost.
The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too. 
</p><p>

<a name="Miranda"></a>
Miranda
Miranda was developed in 1985-86 by David Turner, and is now currently being marketed by Research Software 
Ltd. of England.  Miranda was the successor of the functional languages SASL and KRC.  With Miranda, the main 
goal was to produce a commercial version of a standard non-strict purely functional language.  To make Miranda 
commercially viable, the development environment had to be made very flexible and easy-to-use. 
</p><p>

<a name="ML/SML"></a>
ML/SML	<br>
ML is a general-purpose programming language designed for large projects.
Standard ML is a safe, modular, strict, functional, polymorphic programming language 
with compile-time type checking and type inference, garbage collection, exception handling, 
immutable data types and updatable references, abstract data types, and parametric modules. 
It has efficient implementations and a formal definition with a proof of soundness.
</p><p>
Function calls in ML, like those of C, Pascal, C++, Java, etc., evaluate their arguments 
before entering the body of the function. Such a language is called strict or call-by-value, 
in contrast to some functional programming languages that are lazy or call-by-need. 
Strict evaluation makes it easier for the programmer to reason about the execution of 
the program.

<a name="Modula-2/Modula-3"></a>
Modula-2 / Modula-3
A programming language designed by Niklaus Wirth, the author of Pascal. 
Wirth created Modula-2 in the late 1970s to answer many of the criticisms leveled at 
Pascal, which he had created ten years earlier. In particular, Modula-2 addresses 
Pascal's lack of support for separate compilation of modules and multitasking. 
Although Modula-2 found support in academia, it is not often used for applications.
</p><p>
Modula-3 is a member of the Pascal family of languages. Designed in the late 1980s at 
Digital Equipment Corporation and Olivetti, Modula-3 corrects many of the deficiencies 
of Pascal and Modula-2 for practical software engineering. In particular, Modula-3 keeps 
the simplicity of type safety of the earlier languages, while providing new facilities 
for exception handling, concurrency, object-oriented programming, and automatic garbage 
collection. Modula-3 is both a practical implementation language for large software 
projects and an excellent teaching language.

<a name="node.js"></a>
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a><br>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. It has an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, allowing many concurrent connections without the need for OS threads. Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep. Node.js is governed by the Node.js Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program. Initially released on May 27, 2009.

<a name="Oberon"></a>
<a href="http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/">Oberon</a>
<br>
Oberon is a general-purpose programming language that evolved from Modula-2. Its principal new 
feature is the concept of type extension. It permits the construction of new data types on the basis of 
existing ones and provides relations between them. The Oberon project was launched in 1985 by 
Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht. Although the project was originally targeted towards in-house 
hardware, the language and system have now been ported to many computer platforms. 
The Oberon system is available free of charge and no registration is required for downloading the material.
</p><p>

<a name="Objective-C"></a>
Objective-C<br>	
Objective-C is a object oriented superset of C with a Smalltalk style (infix) message 
syntax. It was originally written by Brad Cox and the StepStone corppration in the early 
1980s. In 1988, it was adopted as the development language for NeXTstep and was made a 
part of the GNU gcc compiler in 1992. It is currently used as the principle programming 
language for MacOSX (which is based on NeXTstep) and as the language for the GNUstep 
project on Linux and other platforms. Objective-C's weak typing and runtime features 
distinguish it from C++ and Java.
</p><p>

<a name="P5.js"></a>
<a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a><br>
P5.js is the javascript version of Processing. Is works like a library of multimedia functions with connections to OpenGL, WebGL, HTML5 DOM, as well as sound.
</p><p>

<a name="Pascal"></a>
Pascal 	<br>
Pronounced pass-kal. A high-level programming language developed by Niklaus Wirth in the 
late 1960s. The language is named after Blaise Pascal, a seventeenth-century French 
mathematician who constructed one of the first mechanical adding machines.
</p><p>
Pascal is best known for its affinity to structured programming techniques. The nature 
of the language forces programmers to design programs methodically and carefully. For 
this reason, it is a popular teaching language.
</p><p>
Despite its success in academia, Pascal has had only modest success in the business world. 
Part of the resistance to Pascal by professional programmers stems from its inflexibility 
and lack of tools for developing large applications.
</p><p>
To address some of these criticisms, Wirth designed a new language called Modula-2. 
Modula-2 is similar to Pascal in many respects, but it contains additional features. 
</p><p>

<a name="Perl"></a>
Perl 	<br>
Short for Practical Extraction and Report Language, Perl is a programming language 
developed by Larry Wall, especially designed for processing text. Because of its strong 
text processing abilities, Perl has become one of the most popular languages for writing 
CGI scripts. Perl is an interpretive language, which makes it easy to build and test simple 
programs.
</p><p>

<a name="PHP"></a>
PHP 	<br>
Self-referentially short for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, an open source, server-side, 
HTML embedded scripting language used to create dynamic Web pages.
</p><p>
In an HTML document, PHP script (similar syntax to that of Perl or C ) is enclosed 
within special PHP tags. Because PHP is embedded within tags, the author can jump 
between HTML and PHP (similar to ASP and Cold Fusion) instead of having to rely on 
heavy amounts of code to output HTML. And, because PHP is executed on the server, the 
client cannot view the PHP code.
</p><p>
PHP can perform any task that any CGI program can do, but its strength lies in its 
compatibility with many types of databases. Also, PHP can talk across networks using 
IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or HTTP.
</p><p>
PHP was created sometime in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. During mid 1997, PHP development 
entered the hands of other contributors. Two of them, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, 
rewrote the parser from scratch to create PHP version 3 (PHP3).
</p><p>

<a name="Pliant"></a>
Pliant<br>
First of all Pliant is a programming language that seeks to get rid of the barrier between low level 
languages like C and high level languages like Java or LISP. In order to achive this Pliant works on 
two levels. First of all there is the "Expression" level in which Pliant resembles LISP in several 
aspects and which contains a rather powerful "eval" semantic. The second level is the "Instruction" 
one which is very much like a subset of C. The concept of Pliant says that compiling is nothing else 
but bringing a program from the Expression to the Instruction level. This is done by a dynamic compiler 
plus optional "meta functions" which are provided by the program or by libraries. Due to the machine 
oriented structure of the Instruction level, Pliant programs are then theoretically as fast as ones written 
in C.
</p><p>
Pliant also removes the need for cryptic configuration files because they are implemented as dynamically 
interpreted Pliant code. This means that configuration files also have the whole spectrum of conditionals, 
includes and so on. But the biggest advantage is having a single syntax for all configurations: Pliant.
</p><p>
In order to use this the applications have to be written in Pliant of course which is why Pliant is also a set 
of standard applications that offer the traditional functionality. Servers for HTTP, FTP, SMTP and POP3 
already exist. In this context it should also be noted that Pliant does have a file system including TCP, 
HTTP, FTP and SMTP which means that URLs can be treated like normal files.
</p><p>
All this lets Pliant blur the border between programming and configuration which was one of the 
motivations for developing it. The step that has to be overcome in order to get into programming is 
lowered since the same language framework used for configuration can be used for programming.
</p><p>
And finally Pliant is also a "high-level" operating system. It runs directly on the Linux kernel or on a 
standard Posix or Windows system. Pliant is then the only user-space process which can work free of 
glue code and legacies. Since there is only a single process needed to run a HTTP server, the system is 
potentially very stable.

<a name="Processing"></a>
<a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>
<br>
One of the aims of Processing is to allow non-programmers to start computer programming aided by visual feedback. The Processing language builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified syntax and a graphics user interface.
</p><p>
<a name="Prolog"></a>
Prolog
<br>
Prolog, a pure logic language was born of a project aimed not at producing a 
programming language but at processing natural languages; in this case, French. 
The project gave rise to a preliminary version of Prolog at the end of 1971 and 
a more definitive version at the end of 1972. This article gives the history of 
this project and describes in detail the preliminary and then the final versions 
of Prolog. The authors also felt it appropriate to describe the Q-systems since 
it was a language which played a prominent part in Prolog's genesis.

<a name="Python"></a>
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
<br>
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language 
developed by Guido van Rossum. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.
</p><p>
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, 
exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces 
to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, 
Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable 
as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
</p><p>
Although Python is copyrighted, the source code is open source, and unlike GNU software, 
it can be commercially re-sold.
</p><p>

<a name="R"></a>
<a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
<br>  
The R programming language, sometimes described as "GNU S". R is considered by
its developers to be an implementation of S, with semantics derived from Scheme.
There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical 
statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and 
graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 
The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, 
and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.
</p><p>
One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots 
can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care 
has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user 
retains full control. 
</p><p>

<a name="Rebol"></a>
<a href="http://www.rebol.com/">Rebol</a>
<br>
REBOL was designed over a 20 year period by Carl Sassenrath, the system architect responsible for 
the world's first multitasking multimedia operating system, the Commodore Amiga OS. The first 
implementation of REBOL (pronounced like "rebel yell") was released in 1997 to a small group of 
users running on three operating systems, and today REBOL has grown to reach more than 1,000,000 
users running on more than 40 OS platforms.
</p><p>
REBOL is not a traditional computer language like C, BASIC, or Java. Instead, REBOL was designed 
to solve one of the fundamental problems in computing: the exchange and interpretation of information 
between distributed computer systems. REBOL accomplishes this through the concept of relative 
expressions (which is how REBOL got its name as the Relative Expression-Based Object Language). 
</p><p>
Relative expressions, also called "dialects", provide greater efficiency for representing code as well as 
data, and they are REBOL's greatest strength. For example, REBOL can not only create a graphical 
user interface in one line of code, but it can also send that line as data to be processed and displayed on 
other Internet computer systems around the world.
</p><p>
REBOL's consistent architecture provides powerful range of capabilities, from its small kernel interpreter 
(called REBOL/Core) up to an entire Internet Operating System (called REBOL/IOS).
</p><p>

<a name="REXX"></a>
REXX	<br>
A programming language designed by Michael Cowlishaw of IBM UK Laboratories.  
Rexx is an acronym which stands for "Restructured Extended Executor Language".  
In Mike's own words: "REXX is a procedural language that allows programs and algorithms 
to be written in a clear and structured way." REXX doesn't look that different from any 
other procedural language.
</p><p>
What makes REXX different from most other languages is that it is also designed to be 
used as a macro language by arbitrary application programs. The idea is that application 
developers don't have to design their own macro languages and interpreters. Instead they 
use REXX as the macro language and support the REXX programming interface.
</p><p>
If a REXX macro comes across an expression or function call that it cannot resolve, it 
can ask the application to handle it instead. The application only has to support the 
features that are specific to it, freeing the developer from handling the mundane 
(and time-consuming) task of writing a language interpreter. And if all applications 
use REXX as their macro language, the user only has to learn one language instead of a dozen.
</p><p>

<a name="RPG"></a>
RPG
<br>
Short for Report Program Generator, a programming language developed by in the 
mid-60's for developing business applications, especially generating reports from data. 
</p><p>
The newest version, RPG IV, is still widely used on AS/400 systems.
Not to be confused with Role-Playing Games, computer games where one or more 
players adopt a role and act it out in a virtual reality. 
</p><p>

<a name="Ruby"></a>
Ruby	<br>
Ruby is free interpreted scripting language,created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, for quick and easy 
object-oriented programming. It has many features to process text files and to do system 
management tasks (as in Perl). It is simple, straight-forward, extensible, and portable.
</p><p>
Ruby has simple syntax, inspired by Eiffel and Ada, exception handling features, like Java or Python, 
to make it easy to  handle errors, in a complete, full, pure object oriented language: OOL. This means all data 
in Ruby is an object, not optional, as with Python or Perl, but in the sense of Smalltalk: no exceptions. 
Ruby features blocks in its syntax (code surrounded by '{' ... '}' or 'do' ... 'end'), and allows for C extensions 
through an extension API. Ruby is developed mostly on Linux, but works on many types of UNIX, DOS, 
Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP, MacOS, BeOS, OS/2, etc.
</p><p>

<a name="S"></a>
S / S system
<br>
S is a language and system for organizing, visualizing, and analyzing data. 
It has been a project of statistics research at Bell Labs since 1976, evolving continually 
through that time. In 1998, S became the first statistical system to receive the Software 
System Award, the top software award from the ACM.
</p><p>
S has from the start been aimed at programming with data; that is, at describing to the 
computer some graphical view, numerical summary, statistical model, or other information 
you want to produce. It occupies a middle ground between packages that emphasize standard 
operations and research projects in language design that start from a more abstract goal. 
S has always been designed to be used in practice, but with an emphasis on users who 
wanted to turn new ideas into software.
</p><p>
S was invented at Bell Labs, and continues to be involved very much in its 
evolution, the implementations actually available, S-Plus and R, are distinct from 
the S language itself.
</p><p>

<a name="S-Lang"></a>
S-Lang	<br>
S-Lang is a free multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a developer to create 
robust multi-platform software. It provides facilities required by interactive applications 
such as display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. The most exciting 
feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may be easily embedded into a program 
to make it extensible.
</p><p>

<a name="S-Plus"></a>
S-Plus
<br>
S-Plus products are distributed by the MathSoft Corporation. In particular, the S-Plus 
language is based on the S software from Bell Labs; MathSoft has an exclusive license 
with Lucent Technologies to distribute software based on S from Bell Labs. 
</p><p>

<a name="Scala"></a>
<a href="http://scala.epfl.ch/">Scala</a>
<br>
Scala is a modern multi-paradigm programming language designed to express common 
programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates 
features of object-oriented and functional languages.
</p><p>
Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. 
Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits. Class abstractions 
are extended by subclassing and a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean 
replacement for multiple inheritance.
</p><p>
Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value. Scala 
provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, it supports higher-order 
functions, it allows functions to be nested, and supports currying. Scala's case classes 
and its built-in support for pattern matching model algebraic types used in many functional 
programming languages.
</p><p>
Furthermore, Scala's notion of pattern matching naturally extends to the processing of 
XML data with the help of regular expression patterns. In this context, sequence 
comprehensions are useful for formulating queries. These features make Scala ideal for 
developing applications like web services. 
</p><p>
Scala is designed to interoperate well with popular programming environments like 
the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) and the .NET CLR. In particular, the interaction 
with mainstream object-oriented languages like Java and C# is as smooth as possible. 
Scala has the same compilation model (separate compilation, dynamic class loading) 
like Java and C# and allows access to thousands of high-quality libraries. 
</p><p>

<a name="Scheme"></a>
Scheme
Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive dialect of the Lisp 
programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman. 
It was designed to have an exceptionally clear and simple semantics and few 
different ways to form expressions. A wide variety of programming paradigms, 
including imperative, functional, and message passing styles, find convenient 
expression in Scheme.
</p><p>

<a name="Smalltalk"></a>
Smalltalk<br>	
An object-oriented operating system and programming language developed at Xerox 
Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center. Smalltalk was the first object-oriented 
programming language (Simula was the very first). Although it never achieved the 
commercial success of other languages such as C++ and Java, Smalltalk is considered 
by many to be the only true object-oriented programming environment, and the one 
against which all others must be compared.
</p><p>

<a name="Squeak"></a>
<a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>
<br>
 Squeak is an open, highly-portable Smalltalk-80 implementation whose virtual machine is written 
 entirely in Smalltalk, making it easy to debug, analyze, and change. To achieve practical performance, 
 a translator produces an equivalent C program whose performance is comparable to commercial 
 Smalltalks.
</p><p>
Other noteworthy aspects of Squeak include
</p><p>
    * real-time sound and music synthesis written entirely in Smalltalk<br>
    * extensions of BitBlt to handle color of any depth and anti-aliased image rotation and scaling<br>
    * network access support that allows simple construction of servers and other useful facilities<br>
    * it runs bit-identical on many platforms (Windows, Mac, Unix, and others)<br>
    * a compact object format that typically requires only a single word of overhead per object<br>
    * a simple yet efficient incremental garbage collector for 32-bit direct pointers<br>
    * efficient bulk-mutation of objects </p><p>
Squeak is available for free via the Internet, at this and other sites. Each release includes 
platform-independent support for color, sound, and network access, with complete source code. 
Originally developed on the Macintosh, members of its user community have since ported it to 
numerous other platforms including Windows 95 and NT, Windows CE (it runs on the Cassiopeia 
and the HP320LX), all common flavors of UNIX, Acorn RiscOS, and a bare chip (the Mitsubishi 
M32R/D).
</p><p>
The Squeak Smalltalk system bears no relation to the "Squeak" language designed by Rob Pike and 
Luca Cardelli in 1985, nor to its successor, "Newsqueak". 
</p><p>

<a name="Tcl/Tk"></a>
Tcl / Tk	<br>
Tool Command Language is a simple-to-learn yet very powerful language. Its syntax is 
described in just a dozen rules, but it has all the features needed to rapidly create 
useful programs in almost any field of application - on a wide variety of platforms.
</p><p>
Tk started out as a graphical toolkit for Tcl, but has since been modified to work on a
variety of languages such as Perl and Python. TK allows you to develop graphical 
applications that run on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and many other platforms.
</p><p>

<a name="VB Script"></a>
VBScript<br>
Visual Basic  Script is owned, maintained, and developed by Microsoft for Microsoft products.
</p><p>
Visual Basic Scripting brings active scripting to a wide variety of environments, 
including Web client scripting in Microsoft Internet Explorer and Web server scripting 
in Microsoft Internet Information Service.
</p><p>
If you already know Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), VBScript will 
be very familiar. Even if you do not know Visual Basic, once you learn VBScript, you are 
on your way to programming with the whole family of Visual Basic languages. 
VBScript talks to host applications using Windows Script.
</p><p>

<a name="VB.NET"></a>
VB.NET<br>
Owned, maintained, and developed by Microsoft for Microsoft products.
Microsoft Visual Basic for the .NET platform. Although it shares the same name, VB.NET
has been dramatically changed to fit the .NET platform.
</p><p>

<a name="Visual Basic"></a>
Visual Basic<br>
A programming language and environment developed by Microsoft. 
Based on the BASIC language, Visual Basic was one of the first 
products to provide a graphical programming environment and a paint 
metaphor for developing user interfaces. Instead of worrying about 
syntax details, the Visual Basic programmer can add a substantial 
amount of code simply by dragging and dropping controls, such as buttons 
and dialog boxes, and then defining their appearance and behavior.
</p><p>
Although not a true object-oriented programming language in the strictest 
sense, Visual Basic nevertheless has an object-oriented philosophy. It is 
sometimes called an event-driven language because each object can react to 
different events such as a mouse click.
Since its launch in 1990, the Visual Basic approach has become the norm for 
programming languages. Now there are visual environments for many programming 
languages, including C, C++, Pascal, and Java. Visual Basic is sometimes called 
a Rapid Application Development (RAD) system because it enables programmers to 
quickly build prototype applications. 
</p><p>

<a name="Windows Script"></a>
Windows Script
</p><p>
With Windows Script, browsers and other host applications do not require special integration code for each scripting 
component. Windows Script enables a host to compile scripts, obtain and call entry points, 
and manage the namespace available to the developer. With Windows Script, language vendors 
can create standard language run times for scripting.
</p><p>
Microsoft is working with various Internet groups to define the Windows Script 
standard so that scripting engines can be interchangeable. Windows Script is used in 
Microsoft Internet Explorer and in Microsoft Internet Information Service.
