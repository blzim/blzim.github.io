<li>Input Output (I/O) Manager = what is going to and from storage or to and from the user.</li>
<li>Network Manager = what is going to and from other systems.</li>
</ul>
User portion includes:
<ul>
<li>User Manager = who is using the system and what are they allowed to access.</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) or shell = text environment for user to use the system with.</li>
<li>Graphic User Interface (GUI) = mouse environment for user to use the system with.</li>
