<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
An Operating System (OS) is the software that manages a computer. There are two major parts to an OS, the kernel space and the user space. The kernel space is concerned with allowing software and users to work with the hardware.
<p>
Kernel functions include:<ul>
<li>Process Manager = what the CPU is processing.</li>
<li>Memory Manager = what the RAM is holding.</li>
<li>File Manager = how DATA is being stored.</li>
<li>Device Manager = what peripherials are being used.</li>
<li>Input Output (I/O) Manager = what is going to and from storage or to and from the user.</li>
<li>Network Manager = what is going to and from other systems.</li>
</ul>
User portion includes:
<ul>
<li>User Manager = who is using the system and what are they allowed to access.</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI) or shell = text environment for user to use the system with.</li>
<li>Graphic User Interface (GUI) = mouse environment for user to use the system with.</li>
<li>System settings = software package managers, system information and status programs, control panel, security tools like anti-virus or firewall programs.</li>
<li>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).</li>
<li>Any other pre-installed programs, like word processing, games, programming languages.</li>
</ul>

File systems can be classified into storage file systems (disk/tpae), network file systems, and special-purpose file systems.
</p><p>
Storage file systmes include FAT (FAT12, FAT16, FAT32), exFAT, NTFS, HFS and HFS+, HPFS, APFS, UFS, ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS, btrfs, ISO 9660, Files-11, Veritas File System, VMFS, ZFS, ReiserFS and UDF. Some disk file systems are journaling file systems or versioning file systems.
</p><p>
ISO 9660 and Universal Disk Format (UDF) are two common formats that target Compact Discs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs. Mount Rainier is an extension to UDF supported since 2.6 series of the Linux kernel and since Windows Vista that facilitates rewriting to DVDs.
</p><p>
A flash file system considers the special abilities, performance and restrictions of flash memory devices. Frequently a disk file system can use a flash memory device as the underlying storage media but it is much better to use a file system specifically designed for a flash device.
</p><p>
A tape file system is a file system and tape format designed to store files on tape in a self-describing form. Magnetic tapes are sequential storage media with significantly longer random data access times than disks, posing challenges to the creation and efficient management of a general-purpose file system.
</p><p>
A network file system is a file system that acts as a client for a remote file access protocol, providing access to files on a server. Programs using local interfaces can transparently create, manage and access hierarchical directories and files in remote network-connected computers. Examples of network file systems include clients for the NFS, AFS, SMB protocols, and file-system-like clients for FTP and WebDAV.
</p><p>
Microsoft Windows storage file system is either FAT, NTFS, exFAT, Live File System and ReFS file systems (the last of these is only supported and usable in Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10; Windows cannot boot from it). Windows uses Server Message Block (SMB) or Common Internet File System (CIFS) for networking wich both work on top of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).
</p><p>
Apple MacOS (formerly Mac OS X) uses the Apple File System (APFS), which recently replaced a file system inherited from classic Mac OS called HFS Plus. MacOS uses Network File System (NFS) and FTP for networking, over TCP/IP.
</p><p>
Lunix uses many file systems for storage, the most common being ext, but it can also use FAT, FAT32, NTFS, and the Network File System (NFS) and FTP, over TCP/IP to name a few.
