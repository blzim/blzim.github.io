Breadboard<br>
(Solder less Prototyping Board) is a construction base for prototyping of electronics, holding components together without requiring solder. This makes it easy to use for creating temporary prototypes and experimenting with circuit design. In the early days of radio, amateurs nailed bare copper wires or terminal strips to a wooden board (often literally a cutting board for bread) and soldered electronic components to them. Breadboards have evolved over time, with the term now being used for all kinds of prototype electronic devices.

C<br>
Programming language designed to have high level syntax, yet allow for low level memory management. A compiled language created by Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T in 1969, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
</p><p>
A standards-compliant and portably written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers. So far except for small high performance areas written in Assembly, all major Operating Systems have been written at least in part in C, including UNIX, Linux, Windows, Apple, BSD, even phones like iPhone and Android. Assembly is the closest to machine language but processor feature based and as such cannot be ported to different processor architectures without being rewritten.
</p><p>
Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C, or were written in C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog, and Unix C shell.

</p><p>
Capacitor<br>
A passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors separated by a insulator. When there is a potential difference across the conductors, an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing positive charge to collect on one plate and negative charge on the other plate. Energy is stored in the electrostatic field.
</p><p>
A capacitor is characterized by a single constant value, capacitance. This is the ratio of the electric charge on each conductor to the potential difference between them. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad, which is equal to one coulomb per volt. They come in fixed, polarized and variable forms, each with a slightly different schematic symbol.
</p><p>
Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass. In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies. In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies. In electric power transmission systems they stabilize voltage and power flow.

</p><p>
Circuit<br>
Circuit is a circular arrangement of electronic components so electric current can flow from the negative to the positive poles of a power supply.

Storage Area Networks can be used to allow a changing amout of hosts to share data.
</p><p>
CMOS<br>
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor is a technology for constructing integrated circuits. CMOS technology is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for several analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensor), data converters, and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication. The word complementary refers to the fact that the typical digital design style with CMOS uses complementary pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) for logic functions.
</p><p>
Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption. Significant power is only drawn when the transistors in the CMOS device are switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, for example transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or NMOS logic. CMOS also allows a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.
</p><p>
The phrase metal oxide semiconductor is a reference to the physical structure of certain field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminum was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-k dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and beyond.

A general term to refer to a part or parts of a circuit without reference to specific names.
</p><p>
Computer Architecture<br>
Defining the structure and relationship of the sub-components of a computer. The highest level of the definition conveys the concepts implement, whereas in building architecture this over-view is normally visual, computer architecture is primarily logical, positing a conceptual system that serves a particular purposes. In both instances (building and computer), many levels of detail are required to completely specify a given implementation. As in building architecture, some of these details are often implied as common practice. For example, at a high level, computer architecture is concerned with how the central processing unit (CPU) acts and how it accesses computer memory. Some currently (2011) fashionable computer architectures include cluster computing and Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA).
</p><p>
Subcategories:<ol>
<li>Instruction set architecture, or ISA. The ISA is the code that a central processor reads and acts upon. It is the machine language (or assembly language), including the instruction set, word size, memory address modes, processor registers, and address and data formats.
<li>Microarchitecture, also known as Computer organization describes the data paths, data processing elements and data storage elements, and describes how they should implement the ISA. The size of a computer's CPU cache for instance, is an organizational issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA.
<li>System Design includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system:
<ul>
<li> Data paths, such as computer buses and switches
<li>Memory controllers and hierarchies
<li>Data processing other than the CPU, such as direct memory access (DMA)

</p><p>
Crystal<br>
A natural or synthetic crystalline material having piezoelectric properties. As a transducer, used to convert dynamic pressures (vibrations) to ac electricity or change ac electricity into vibrations.
</p><p>
Crystal Oscillator<br>
An electronic oscillator circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is the quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits designed around them became known as crystal oscillators.
</p><p>
Crystals<br>
High-frequency crystals are typically cut in the shape of a simple, rectangular plate. Low-frequency crystals, such as those used in digital watches, are typically cut in the shape of a tuning fork. For applications not needing very precise timing, a low-cost ceramic resonator is often used in place of a quartz crystal. When a crystal of quartz is properly cut and mounted, it can be made to distort in an electric field by applying a voltage to an electrode near or on the crystal. This property is known as piezoelectricity. When the field is removed, the quartz will generate an electric field as it returns to its previous shape, and this can generate a voltage. Quartz has the further advantage that its elastic constants and its size change in such a way that the frequency dependence on temperature can be very low. The specific characteristics will depend on the mode of vibration and the angle at which the quartz is cut. Therefore, the resonant frequency of the plate, which depends on its size, will not change much, either. This means that a quartz clock, filter or oscillator will remain accurate.
</p><p>
The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator. The rate of expansion and contraction of the quartz is the resonant frequency, and is determined by the cut and size of the crystal. When the energy of the generated output frequencies matches the losses in the circuit, an oscillation can be sustained. An oscillator crystal has two electrically conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the circuit around the crystal applies a random noise AC signal to it, and purely by chance, a tiny fraction of the noise will be at the resonant frequency of the crystal. The crystal will therefore start oscillating in synchrony with that signal. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal's frequency band will become stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. The narrow resonance band of the quartz crystal filters out all the unwanted frequencies.

</p><p>
Database<br>
The term database is commonly used to refer to any collection of related data (such as a spreadsheet).
</p><p>
Software Database Management Systems can be classified into four main functional groups:<ul>
<li>Data definition: Creation, modification and removal of definitions that define the organization of the data.
<li>Update: Insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data (aka Data Entry).
<li>Retrieval: Providing information in a form directly usable or for further processing by other applications.
<li>Administration: Managing users, security, performance, data integrity, concurrency control, and recovering information that has been corrupted by some event such as an unexpected system failure.
</ul>
</p><p>

</p><p>
DC supply<br>
Any Direct Current electrical power supply, usually a battery, sometimes a device that converts AC to DC.
</p><p>
DC to DC Converter<br>
DC to DC converter is a switch-mode power supply that converts one DC voltage level to another, by storing the input energy temporarily and then releasing that energy to the output at a different voltage. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components like capacitors. (See Buck converter or voltage regulator module).

DDOS<br>
1. Distributed Denial Of Service, a method of flooding a system with requests until it becomes so busy it is useless.
2. Data Domain Operating System, a linux shell created by and used in Data Domain products.
</p><p>
DDPST switch<br>
Dual On-Off Double Pole, Single Throw switch is often used to switch mains electricity because it can isolate both the live and neutral connections.
</p><p>
DDR<br>
Double Data Rate, SDRAM standard interface. DDR2 (2003) = 1GB stick; DDR3 (2007) = 16GB stick; DDR4 (2014) = 512GB stick. These revisions are not forward or backward compatable with one another.
</p><p>
DDR SDRAM<br>
Double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory, the current form of computer main memory. The interface uses double pumping (transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal) to lower the clock frequency. One advantage of keeping the clock frequency down is that it reduces the signal integrity requirements on the circuit board connecting the memory to the controller. The name double data rate refers to the fact that a DDR SDRAM with a certain clock frequency achieves nearly twice the bandwidth of a SDR SDRAM running at the same clock frequency, due to this double pumping. Standards are set by JEDEC standards group.
</p><p>
DIB<br>
Device Interface Board, a type of printed circuit board (PCB), similar to a daughter board, often associated with testing circuit boards.
</p><p>
Dielectric<br>
An electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in a conductor, but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization. Because of dielectric polarization, positive charges are displaced toward the field and negative charges shift in the opposite direction.
</p><p>
The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials. It is important to explain various phenomena in electronics, optics, and solid-state physics.
</p><p>
While the term insulator implies low electrical conduction, dielectric typically means materials with a high polarizability. The term insulator is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while the term dielectric is used to indicate the energy storing capacity of the material (by means of polarization). A common example of a dielectric is the electrically insulating material between the metallic plates of a capacitor.

</p><p>
Differential Signalling<br>

A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p-n junction connected to two electrical terminals. Semiconductor diodes were the first semiconductor electronic devices. The discovery of crystals' rectifying abilities was made by German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1874. The first semiconductor diodes, called cat's whisker diodes, developed around 1906, were made of mineral crystals such as galena. Today most diodes are made of silicon.

</p><p>
Duty Cycle<br>
The ratio of pulse width to period, indicates the percentage of time a pulse is present during a cycle.
</p><p>
DRAM<br>
Dynamic Random Access Memory stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a memory cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it. The capacitor is volatile and leaks a small amount of current and so needs to be periodically refreshed typically every 64ms. DRAM is currently the common computer system main memory type and packaged in Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMM). Modern DIMMs add a clock line to synchronize the memory interface and so are called Sychronized or SDIMM.
</p><p>
The most significant change, and the primary reason that SDRAM has supplanted asynchronous RAM, is the support for multiple internal banks inside the DRAM chip. Using a few bits of bank address which accompany each command, a second bank can be activated and begin reading data while a read from the first bank is in progress. By alternating banks, an SDRAM device can keep the data bus continuously busy, in a way that asynchronous DRAM cannot.

EEPROM<br>
Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory, see Read Only Memory. Flash memory is a later form of EEPROM. In the industry, there is a convention to reserve the term EEPROM to byte-wise erasable memories compared to block-wise erasable flash memories. EEPROM takes more die area than flash memory for the same capacity because each cell usually needs both a read, write and erase transistor, while in flash memory the erase circuits are shared by large blocks of cells (often 512x8).

A device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most work with magnetic fields and conductors to generate force. These types of motors include fans, blowers, pumps, compressors, power tools, and disk drives, to name a few. They may be powered by AC or DC. Some devices convert electricity into motion but do not generate usable mechanical power as a primary objective, and so are not generally referred to as electric motors. For example, magnetic solenoids and loudspeakers are usually described as actuators and transducers, respectively, instead of motors.

An electrical conductor used to make contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit. The anode is now defined as the electrode at which electrons leave the cell and oxidation occurs, and the cathode as the electrode at which electrons enter the cell and reduction occurs. Each electrode may become either the anode or the cathode depending on the direction of current through the cell. A bipolar electrode is an electrode that functions as the anode of one cell and the cathode of another cell.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Electrolytic Capacitor<br>
A capacitor that uses an electrolyte (an ionic conducting liquid) as one of its plates to achieve a larger capacitance per unit volume than other types, but with performance disadvantages. All capacitors conduct alternating current (AC) and block direct current (DC) and can be used, amongst other applications, to couple circuit blocks allowing AC signals to be transferred while blocking DC power, to store energy, and to filter signals according to their frequency. The large capacitance of electrolytic capacitors makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing large amounts of energy. They are widely used in power supplies and for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC power connections.

Broadband come from incidental emitters like power lines, electric motors, thermostats, or anywhere electricity is being turned off and on rapidly.
</p><p>
EPROM<br>
Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory, is a type of memory chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. In other words, it is non-volatile. It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light source (such as from a mercury-vapor light). EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent fused quartz window in the top of the package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to UV light during erasing. The difference between EPROM and EEPROM lies in the way that the memory programs and erases.
</p><p>
Ethernet<br>

Developed by Robert Metcalf in 1973 and standardized as IEEE 802.3 in 1983 @ 3mbps, current rates are 100Gbps, with 400Gbps currently expected in 2017. Ethernet uses packet switched networking and breaks data streams into chucks it calls Frames. It uses CAT cables and CSMA/CD error recovery. Each ethernet segment is a single collison domain. Segments are connected together with a switch. All switched segments are one broadcast domain. Different broadcast domains can be connected with a router. Today router and switch functions are oftain combine in a single piece of hardware called a layer 3 switch.

Farad<br>
Farad is the unit of capacitance. A farad is the charge in coulombs which a capacitor will accept for the potential across it to change 1 volt. A coulomb is 1 ampere second. Example: A capacitor with capacitance of 47 nF will increase by 1 volt per second with a 47 nA input current.
</p><p>
For electronics, one farad is a fairly large amount of capacitance. The most commonly used submultiples in electrical and electronic usage are the microfarad, nanofarad and picofarad. 1 microfarad (uF) = one millionth (10-6) of a farad, or 1000000 pF, or 1000 nF; 1 nanofarad (nF) = one billionth (10-9) of a farad, or 1000 pF; 1 picofarad (pF) = one trillionth (10-12) of a farad.

FC<br>
Fibre Channel, bus used for SAN network storage.
</p><p>
FET<br>
Field Effect Transistor uses an electric field to control the shape and hence the conductivity of a channel of one type of charge carrier in a semiconductor material. FETs are sometimes called unipolar transistors to contrast their single-carrier-type operation with the dual-carrier-type operation of bipolar (junction) transistors (BJT). The concept of the FET predates the BJT, though it was not physically implemented until after BJTs due to the limitations of semiconductor materials and the relative ease of manufacturing BJTs compared to FETs at the time.
</p><p>
The main advantage of the FET is its high input resistance, on the order of 100M ohms or more. Thus, it is a voltage-controlled device, and shows a high degree of isolation between input and output. It is a unipolar device, depending only upon majority current flow. It is less noisy and is thus found in FM tuners for quiet reception. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero drain current and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. The main disadvantage of the FET is that it has a relatively low gain-bandwidth compared to a BJT.
</p><p>
FGMOS<br>

</p><p>
Flash Memory<br>
An electronic non-volatile computer storage medium that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed, developed from EEPROM.
</p><p>
There are two main types of flash memory, which are named after the NAND and NOR logic gates. The internal characteristics of the individual flash memory cells exhibit characteristics similar to those of the corresponding gates. Whereas EPROMs had to be completely erased before being rewritten, NAND type flash memory may be written and read in blocks (or pages) which are generally much smaller than the entire device.

</p><p>
Ground<br>
The common return path for current in an electrical circuit.  Serves as a reference point for measuring all other potentials in a circuit.  Generally assumed to be at zero potential with respect to the earth.  Other than earth references may be used such as the chassis of an automobile (chassis ground) or some arbitrary point in a circuit (circuit ground) like the negative side of the power source.
</p><p>
Ground Plane<br>
A ground plane on a printed circuit board (PCB) is a large area or layer of copper foil connected to the circuit's ground point, usually one terminal of the power supply. It serves as the return path for current from many different components.
</p><p>
A ground plane is often made as large as possible, covering most of the area of the PCB which is not occupied by circuit traces. In multilayer PCBs, it is often a separate layer covering the entire board. This serves to make circuit design easier, allowing the designer to ground any component without having to run additional traces; component leads needing grounding are routed directly through a hole in the board to the ground plane on another layer. The large area of copper also conducts the large return currents from many components without significant voltage drops, ensuring that the ground connection of all the components are at the same reference potential.
</p><p>
Harvard Architecture<br>
A computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for instructions and data. The term originated from the Harvard Mark I relay-based computer, which stored instructions on punched tape (24 bits wide) and data in electromechanical counters. 
</p><p>	
These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit, and provided no access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not boot itself. Today, most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons but actually implement a modified Harvard Architecture, so they can support tasks such as loading a program from disk storage as data and then executing it.
</p><p>
Modified Harvard architecture is a variation of the Harvard computer architecture that allows the contents of the instruction memory to be accessed as if it were data. Most modern computers that are documented as Harvard architecture are, in fact, Modified Harvard architecture. The physical separation of instruction and data memory is sometimes held to be the distinguishing feature of modern Harvard architecture computers. 
</p><p>
With microcontrollers (entire computer systems integrated onto single chips), the use of different memory technologies for instructions (e.g. flash memory) and data (typically read/write memory) in von Neumann machines is becoming popular. The true distinction of a Harvard machine is that instruction and data memory occupy different address spaces. In other words, a memory address does not uniquely identify a storage location (as it does in a Von Neumann machine); you also need to know the memory space (instruction or data) to which the address belongs.

An ISA includes a specification of the set of op-codes (machine language), and the native commands implemented by a particular processor. Computers with different micro-architectures can share a common instruction set. For example, the Intel Pentium and the AMD Athlon implement nearly identical versions of the x86 instruction set, but have radically different internal designs.
</p><p>
Insulation<br>
Nonconductive material used to cover wires and components to prevent shock and short circuits.
</p><p>
Insulator<br>
A material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely, and therefore does not conduct an electric current under the influence of an electric field. A perfect insulator does not exist, but some materials such as glass, paper and Teflon, which have high resistivity, are very good electrical insulators. A much larger class of materials, even though they may have lower bulk resistivity, are still good enough to insulate electrical wiring and cables. Examples include rubber-like polymers and most plastics. Such materials can serve as practical and safe insulators for low to moderate voltages (hundreds, or even thousands, of volts).
</p><p>
Insulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical conductors without allowing current through themselves. An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called insulation. The term insulator is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach electric power distribution or transmission lines to utility poles and transmission towers.
</p><p>
Internal resistance<br>
The resistance within a power source.
</p><p>
Inverter<br>
An electrical device that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). The converted AC can be at any required voltage and frequency with the use of appropriate transformers, switching, and control circuits.
</p><p>
In one simple inverter circuit, DC power is connected to a transformer through the center tap of the primary winding (coil). A switch is rapidly switched back and forth to allow current to flow back to the DC source following two alternate paths through one end of the primary winding and then the other. The alternation of the direction of current in the primary winding of the transformer produces alternating current (AC) in the secondary circuit.
</p><p>
The electromechanical version of the switching device includes two stationary contacts and a spring supported moving contact. The spring holds the movable contact against one of the stationary contacts and an electromagnet pulls the movable contact to the opposite stationary contact. The current in the electromagnet is interrupted by the action of the switch so that the switch continually switches rapidly back and forth. This type of electromechanical inverter switch, called a vibrator or buzzer, was once used in vacuum tube automobile radios. A similar mechanism has been used in door bells, buzzers and tattoo guns.
</p><p>
As they became available with adequate power ratings, transistors and various other types of semiconductor switches have been incorporated into inverter circuit designs. Basically nowadays its a practice to use thyristors. SCR's are incorporated for better and efficient switching and their variable firing range which make them adequate for usage in variable range.

The development of this interface specification was led by Intel Corporation and is supported by more than 200 computer systems vendors, such as Cisco, Dell, HP. It consists of a main controller, called the baseboard management controller (BMC) and other management controllers distributed among different system modules that are referred to as satellite controllers. The satellite controllers within the same chassis connect to the BMC via the system interface called Intelligent Platform Management Bus/Bridge (IPMB)  an enhanced implementation of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit).

Non-Uniform Memory Access is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to a processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory, that is, memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors. Modern CPUs operate considerably faster than the main memory they use. NUMA attempts to address this problem by providing separate memory for each processor, avoiding the performance hit when several processors attempt to address the same memory.

PBR<br>
Partition Boot Record is the first block of any bootable partition. It is also sometimes referred to as the Volume Boot Record (VBR). The MBR (or the GRUB chainloader) loads the PBR into memory and transfers control to it. Whereas the MBR code is operating-system independent, the code in the PBR is supplied by and works with a particular OS. In general, the job of the code in the PBR is to load a slightly larger next-step program.
</p><p>
The code in the PBR can't read a file system's directory structure to locate this next piece of code to load. Such file-system-specific code would be too large to fit in the single 512 sector Instead a specific disk address for the next chunk is stored within the PPR.
</p><p>
For Windows the PBR loads an additional 16 sectors from the beginning of the partition. These sectors constitute the first stage of the Windows boot loader which in turn loads one of two files depending on the version of Window: For versions of Windows up to XP, the file NTLDR is loaded into memory. PBR then transfers to NTLDR. For Vista and subsequent versions of Windows, the PBR loads bootmgr, the Boot Manager, into memory and transfers to that.
</p><p>
For Linux there are two popular boot loaders: LILO (Linux Loader) and GRUB (The Grand Unified Boot Loader). The latter is newer and has largely replaced LILO. For GRUB the PBR contains GRUB Stage 1. This code locates and runs the first sector of GRUB stage 1.5.

Many tight lanes can lead to noise, since the reciever only detects the different between the signals, noise affects both pairs the same so it gets ignored.
</p><p>
PCIe versions are called generations. Speeds are determined by how many lanes and which generation the lanes are. 
Most PCIe are 32bit gen 3 with max lanes of 16 referred to as  x16 or by 16. Gen 3 lanes  = 8 GT/s (giga transfers per second) each, each direction so, Gen3 x16 = 15.75 Gbps (gigabits per second). Gen 3 was standardized in 2010.

Python<br>
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
</p><p>
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library. It is simple enough for small scripts and can scale up to very large applications. 
</p><p>
Python is an interpreted language, meaning it can be run without first having to compile the code. Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code execution on a wide variety of systems. Linux and Apple come with Python pre-installed. Using third-party tools, such as Py2exe or Pyinstaller, Python code can be packaged into stand-alone executable programs for most operating systems, allowing for the distribution of Python-based software for use on those environments without requiring the installation of a Python interpreter.
</p><p>
RAID<br>
Redundant Array of Independent Disks, combines multiple drives into a single drive. 
RAID 0 consists of striping, without mirroring or parity. There is no added redundancy for handling disk failures. Striping distributes the contents of files roughly equally among all disks in the set, which results in performance improvements. 
</p><p>
RAID 1 consists of data mirroring, without parity or striping. Data is written identically to two (or more) drives, thereby producing a mirrored set of drives. 
</p><p>
RAID 2 consists of bit-level striping with dedicated Hamming-code parity. All disk spindle rotation is synchronized and data is striped such that each sequential bit is on a different drive. 
</p><p>
RAID 3 consists of byte-level striping with dedicated parity. All disk spindle rotation is synchronized and data is striped such that each sequential byte is on a different drive. Parity is calculated across corresponding bytes and stored on a dedicated parity drive.
</p><p>
RAID 4 consists of block-level striping with dedicated but unreliable parity. 
</p><p>
RAID 5 consists of block-level striping with distributed parity. Unlike in RAID 4, parity information is distributed among the drives. It requires that all drives but one be present to operate. Upon failure of a single drive, subsequent reads can be calculated from the distributed parity such that no data is lost. RAID 5 requires at least three disks.
</p><p>
RAID 6 consists of block-level striping with double distributed parity. Double parity provides fault tolerance up to two failed drives. RAID 6 requires a minimum of four disks. With a RAID 6 array it is possible to mitigate most of the problems associated with RAID 5.

In the relational model of a database, all data is represented in terms of tuples (an ordered list or sequence), and grouped into relations. The purpose is to organize data in terms of its content and be able to retrieve all related data to the content specified. Related records are linked together with a key and results can be displayed by any of the record fields. For example you might create a customer database that includes name and adress, then run a report that sorts the data by zip code. These reports are created using a query language, see SQL.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Rectifier<br>
An electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. The process is known as rectification. Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves, solid-state diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically, even synchronous electromechanical switches and motors have been used.
</p><p>
Rectifiers have many uses, but are often found serving as components of DC power supplies and high-voltage direct current power transmission systems. Rectification may serve in roles other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power. The simple process of rectification produces a type of DC characterized by pulsating voltages and currents (although still unidirectional). Depending upon the type of end-use, this type of DC current may then be further modified into the type of relatively constant voltage DC characteristically produced by such sources as batteries and solar cells. (for DC to AC see inverter)

Resistance is measured in Ohms, an ohm is equivalent to a volt per ampere.
</p><p>
Resonance<br>
In physics, resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at greater amplitude at some frequencies than at others. These are known as the system's resonant frequencies (or resonance frequencies). At these frequencies, even small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude oscillations, because the system stores vibrational energy.

Interpreted scripting language created by IBM in 1979 and eventually made its way into almost every OS in existence by 1990. The Amiga version of Rexx, called ARexx, was included with AmigaOS 2 onwards and was popular for scripting as well as application control. Many Amiga applications have an ARexx port built into them which allows control of the application from Rexx. One single Rexx script could even switch between different Rexx ports in order to control several running applications. It was designed to be a macro or scripting language for any system. As such, Rexx is considered a precursor to Tcl and Python.

</p><p>
SCR<br>
Semiconductor Controlled Rectifier is a four-layer solid state device that controls current. This device is generally used in switching applications. In the normal off state, the device restricts current to the leakage current. When the gate-to-cathode voltage exceeds a certain threshold, the device turns on and conducts current. The device will remain in the on state even after gate current is removed so long as current through the device remains above the holding current. Once current falls below the holding current for an appropriate period of time, the device will switch off.
</p><p>
SCRs are mainly used in devices where the control of high power, possibly coupled with high voltage, is demanded. Their operation makes them suitable for use in medium to high-voltage AC power control applications, such as lamp dimming, regulators and motor control. SCRs and similar devices are used for rectification of high power AC in high-voltage direct current power transmission. They are also used in the control of welding machines.

Surface Mount Device technology became widely used by the mid 1990s. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly on to the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.
</p><p>

Intel Scalable Memory Interconnect, consists of the Command/Address bus, data bus, error signal, and reference clock signals.
</p><p>
SMP<br>
Symmetric Multi Processing involves a multiprocessor computer hardware architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single shared main memory and are controlled by a single OS instance. Most common multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors. Processors may be interconnected using buses, crossbar switches or on-chip mesh networks. The bottleneck in the scalability of SMP using buses or crossbar switches is the bandwidth and power consumption of the interconnect among the various processors, the memory, and the disk arrays. Mesh architectures avoid these bottlenecks, and provide nearly linear scalability to much higher processor counts at the sacrifice of programmability.
</p><p>
Compared with older Asymetric Multi Processing, where one CPU acts as a boss, scheduling tasks for the other processors to complete, SMP acts more like Peer to peer processing.

SMR<br>
Shingled Magnetic Recording is used in hard disk drives (HDDs) to increase storage density and overall per-drive storage capacity. Conventional hard disk drives record data by writing non-overlapping magnetic tracks parallel to each other, while shingled recording writes new tracks that overlap part of the previously written magnetic track, leaving the previous track thinner and allowing for higher track density. Thus, the tracks partially overlap similar to roof shingles. This approach was selected because physical limitations prevent recording magnetic heads from having the same width as reading heads, leaving recording heads wider.
</p><p>
SoC<br>
System On a Chip, a single IC with an entire computer system on it.
</p><p>
Sockets<br>
A socket address is the combination of an IP address and a port number, much like one end of a telephone connection is the combination of a phone number and a particular extension. Based on this address, internet sockets deliver incoming data packets to the appropriate application process or thread.
</p><p>
Within the operating system and the application that created a socket, a socket is referred to by a unique integer value called a socket descriptor. The operating system forwards the payload of incoming IP packets to the corresponding application by extracting the socket address information from the IP and transport protocol headers and stripping the headers from the application data.
</p><p>
A socket API is an application programming interface (API), usually provided by the operating system, that allows application programs to control and use network sockets.
</p><p>
Several socket types are available:
<ul>
<li>Network socket is an endpoint of an inter-process communication across a computer network.
<li>Datagram sockets, also known as connectionless sockets, which use User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
<li>Stream sockets, also known as connection-oriented sockets, which use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
<li>Raw sockets, typically available in routers and other network equipment. Here TCP is bypassed, and the packet headers are made accessible to the application.
<li>Systems Network Architecture (SNA) are implemented without TCP.
<li>Unix domain sockets (UDS), for internal inter-process communication.
</ul>

The term is also often used to refer to a solenoid valve, which is an integrated device containing an electromechanical solenoid which actuates either a pneumatic or hydraulic valve, or a solenoid switch, which is a specific type of relay that internally uses an electromechanical solenoid to operate an electrical switch; for example, an automobile starter solenoid, or a linear solenoid, which is an electromechanical solenoid.
</p><p>
Solid-State<br>
Circuit devices built entirely from solid materials and in which the electrons, or other charge carriers, are confined entirely within the solid material. The term is often used to contrast with the earlier technologies of vacuum and gas-discharge tube devices and it is also conventional to exclude electro-mechanical devices (relays, switches, hard drives and other devices with moving parts) from the term solid state. 
</p><p>
While solid-state can include crystalline, polycrystalline and amorphous solids and refer to electrical conductors, insulators and semiconductors, the building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and DRAM. DRAM devices are used in computers, flash drives and more recently, solid state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard drives. 
</p><p>
A considerable amount of electromagnetic and quantum-mechanical action takes place within the device. The expression became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tube technology to semiconductor diodes and transistors. More recently, the integrated circuit (IC), the light-emitting diode (LED), and the liquid-crystal display (LCD) have evolved as further examples of solid-state devices.
</p><p>
In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively-charged electrons and as positively-charged electron deficiencies called electron holes or just holes. In some semiconductors, the current consists mostly of electrons; in other semiconductors, it consists mostly of holes. Both the electron and the hole are called charge carriers.
</p><p>
For data storage, solid-state devices are much faster and more reliable but are usually more expensive. Although solid-state costs continually drop, disks, tapes, and optical disks also continue to improve their cost/performance ratio.

Von Neumann Architecture<br>
A computer architecture proposal by the mathematician and early computer scientist John von Neumann and others, dated June 30, 1945, entitled First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms The meaning of the term has evolved to mean a stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the Von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system. The design of a Von Neumann architecture is simpler than the more modern Harvard architecture which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for memory, and another set of address and data buses for fetching instructions.
