<p><b>Motherboards</b><br>
<br>
The main printed circuit board in an electronic device, which contains 
sockets that accept additional boards. In a personal computer, the motherboard contains the bus, CPU and coprocessor sockets, memory sockets, keyboard controller and supporting chips.
Chips that control the video display, serial and parallel ports, mouse and disk drives may or may not be present on the motherboard. If not, they are independent controllers that are plugged into an expansion slot on the motherboard.
<p>
There are many types of motherboards. Below is an old AT (Advanced Technology) style desktop motherboard that dominated PCs in the 1970s and 80s. The big feature of this PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is it allows for adapter cards that plug into expansion slots which allows additional hardware variety and connections to the system.
