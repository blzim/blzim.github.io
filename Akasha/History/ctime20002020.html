<b>2000: Smartphones</b>
<table><td><img src="pics20002020/2000_smartphone.jpg"></td><td>
A smartphone is a mobile phone with an advanced mobile operating system which combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. 
<br>
<br>
Smartphones have cell phone featues, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and text messages, and features of a computer, such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital still and video cameras, web browsers, and email. They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers 70% or more of the front surface. The display is often a touchscreen, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate user programs. Communication occurs over mobile broadband with data choices of either mobile broadband or local Wi-Fi.
<br>
<br>
The Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones which accumulated an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide. Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013.

<td> With a little preparation, turns out not to be the end of the world after all. It was speculated that computer programs could stop working or produce erroneous results because they stored years with only two digits and that the year 2000 would be represented by 00 and would be interpreted by software as the year 1900. This would cause date comparisons to produce incorrect results. It was also thought that embedded systems, making use of similar date logic, might fail and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.<br>
<br>
Special committees were set up by governments to monitor remedial work and contingency planning, particularly by crucial infrastructures such as telecommunications, utilities and the like, to ensure that the most critical services had fixed their own problems and were prepared for problems with others. It was only the safe passing of the main "event horizon" itself, January 1, 2000, that fully quelled public fears.

(NT 5.0) Microsoft continues to improve the NT line.Windows 2000 comes in four versions: Professional, Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server. Windows 2000 is classified as a hybrid-kernel operating system, and its architecture is divided into two modes: user mode and kernel mode. The kernel mode provides unrestricted access to system resources and facilitates the user mode, which is heavily restricted and designed for most applications. <br>
<br>
All versions of the operating system support the Windows NT filesystem, NTFS 5, the Encrypted File System (EFS), as well as basic and dynamic disk storage. Dynamic disk storage allows different types of volumes to be used. The Windows 2000 Server family has enhanced functionality, including the ability to provide Active Directory services (a hierarchical framework of resources), Distributed File System (a file system that supports sharing of files) and fault-redundant storage volumes.

Mac OS X is the successor to the original Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. <br>
<br>
Unlike its predecessor, Mac OS X is a multi-user, pre-emptively multitasking, Unix-like operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980's and up until Apple Computer purchased the company in early 1997. Mac OS X is based on the Mach kernel and the BSD implementation of Unix, which were incorporated into NEXTSTEP, the object-oriented operating system developed by Steve Jobs' NeXT company after he left Apple in 1985.

<p>
<b>Floating Gate Transistor</b>
<p>
<img src="pics20002020/2000_FloatingGateTransistor.png"></td><td>
USB flash drives are NAND-type flash memory data storage devices integrated with a USB interface. They are typically small, lightweight, removable and rewritable. As of November 2006, memory capacities for USB Flash Drives currently are sold from 32 megabytes up to 64 gigabytes.
<br>
<br>
USB flash drives offer potential advantages over other portable storage devices, particularly the floppy disk. They are more compact, generally 
faster, hold more data, and may be more reliable (due to their lack of moving parts) than floppy disks. 
<br>
<br>
IBM was the first North American seller of a USB flash drive, and marketed an 8 MB version of the product in 2001 under the "Memory Key" moniker. Lexar can also lay claim to a pioneering USB flash drive product. In 2000 they introduced a Compact Flash (CF) card having an internal USB function.
<br>
<br>
But the technology behind devices like Flash Memory cards and USB Flash Drives come from Flash Memory, which was invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka while working for Toshiba in 1984. According to Toshiba, the name 'Flash' was suggested by Dr. Masuoka's colleague, Mr. Shoji Ariizumi, because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of a flash of a camera.
<br>
<br>
There are two types of Flash memory, NOR and NAND. NAND is the common form found in devices like memory cards, USB Flash drives, audio players, digital cameras, video games, PDAs and mobile Phones. 
<br>
<br>
In a computer, working memory is placed in RAM, which allows the information to be randomly accessed, but will lose the information without a steady flow of electricity, so changes are saved into long term memory storage, which is usually on a hard drive or CD. Flash memory has the ability to allow random access like RAM, yet is a form of non-volatile storage, meaning it does not require a steady stream of electricity.
<br>
<br>
Flash memory stores information in an array of floating gate transistors, called "cells", each of which traditionally stores one bit of information. 
<br>
<br>
Newer flash memory devices, sometimes referred to as multi-level cell devices, can store more than 1 bit per cell, by using more than two levels of electrical charge, placed on the floating gate of a cell.
<br>
<br>
In a Floating Gate Transistor, oxide surrounds the floating gate entirely, so an electrical charge trapped on the floating gate remains there. The charge stored on the floating gate can be modified by applying voltages to the source, drain, and control gate terminals. This is what keeps the memory state when the power is off.
<br>
<br>
Standard computer RAM is currently much faster than Flash, or any other ROM, but work is in place to create Flash memory that is as fast as RAM. ROM technology like Flash goes back many years, but 2000 is definately the year that USB Flash Drives began popping up all over the place. As of 2016 1TB capacity has been released with no end in sight.

<img src="pics20002020/2002_net.jpg"></td><td>
Microsoft releases .NET web services development platform.Programs written for the .NET framework execute in a software environment that manages the program's runtime requirements. This runtime environment, which is also a part of the .NET framework, is known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR provides the appearance of an application virtual machine, so that programmers need not consider the capabilities of the specific CPU that will execute the program. The CLR also provides other important services such as security guarantees, memory management, and exception handling.<br>
<br>
The class library and the CLR together comprise the .NET framework. The framework is intended to make it easier to develop computer applications and to reduce the vulnerability of applications and computers to security threats. First released in 2002, it is included with current versions of Microsoft Windows, and can be installed on most older versions.

<img src="pics20002020/2002_vsNet.png"></td><td>
Microsoft released Visual Studio .NET in 2002 (the beta version was released on the Microsoft developer network in 2001). The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the .NET Framework. Programs developed using .NET are not compiled to machine language (like C++ is, for example) but instead to a format called MSIL or CIL. When an MSIL application is executed, it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine language for the platform it is being executed on, thereby making code portable across multiple platforms. Programs compiled into MSIL can be executed only on platforms which have an implementation of Common Language Infrastructure. It is possible to run MSIL programs in Linux or Mac OS X using non-Microsoft .NET implementations like Mono and DotGNU.<br>
<br>
Microsoft introduced C#, a new programming language, that targets .NET. It also introduced the successor to Visual J++ called Visual J#. Visual J# programs use Java's language syntax. However, unlike Visual J++ programs, Visual J# programs can only target the .NET Framework, not the Java Virtual Machine that all other Java tools target.<br>
<br>
Visual Basic was drastically changed to fit the new framework, and the new version was called Visual Basic .NET. Microsoft also added extensions to C++, called Managed Extensions for C++, so that C++ programmers could create .NET programs.<br>
<br>
Visual Studio .NET can be used to make applications targeting Windows (using Windows Forms, part of the .NET Framework), Web (using ASP.NET and Web Services) and, with an add-in, portable devices (using the .NET Compact Framework).

Contrary to popular belief, GameCube discs are not physically read any differently from a standard DVD disc, but are encrypted with a key derived from the Burst Cutting Area, a 'bar code' unreadable by most DVD drives.

<b>2003: SATA</b>
<table><td>
<img src="pics20002020/2003Sata.jpg"></td>
<td>Serial  ATA is a computer bus technology primarily designed for transfer of data to and from a hard disk. It is the successor to Advanced Technology Attachment standard (ATA). This older technology was retroactively renamed Parallel ATA (PATA) to distinguish it from Serial ATA. Both SATA and PATA drives are IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) drives, although IDE is often misused to indicate PATA drives. 
<br>
<br>
SATA drives are hot plugable and use smaller power and interfact cables. Unlike PATA, SATA drives cannot share the bus, so each device has a dedicated cable and bandwidth.
<br>
<br>
SATA drives may be plugged into Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) controllers and communicate on the same physical cable as native SAS disks. SAS disks, however, may not be plugged into a SATA controller.
<br>
<br>
First-generation SATA interfaces, also known as SATA/150 or SATA 1, run at 1.5 gigabits per second (Gbit/s), but uses encoding at the physical layer, resulting in an actual data transfer rate of 1.2 Gbit/s, or 150 megabytes per second (MB/s). The relative simplicity of a serial link 
and the use of LVDS allow both the use of longer drive cables and an easier transition path to higher speeds.
<br>
<br>
Second generation SATA is known as SATA 3.0 Gbit/s, and runs at 2.4 Gbit/s or 300MB/s. The new controllers maintain backwards compatiblity with original SATA devices.
<br>
<br>
External SATA is commonly called eSATA. Currently, most PC motherboards do not have an eSATA connector. eSATA may be enabled through 
<br>
<br>
the addition of an eSATA host bus adapter (HBA) or bracket connector for desktop systems or with a Cardbus or ExpressCard for notebooks.

<table><td>
<img src="pics20002020/2003_linksysCisco.gif"></td><td>
One notable result of Cisco buying Linksys was the WRT54G router. To minimize costs, Linksys decided to base the firmware on Linux. In 2003, Columbia Law School Professor Eben Moglen pointed out that due to the Linux-based nature of the firmware, Cisco was legally obliged to release the source code to the routers, under the terms of the Linux GNU General Public License. Cisco acknowledged its obligation, released the code, and revealed the secrets of how the software code interfaced to the hardware.<br>
<br>
This subsequently spawned an open source community, dedicated to modding Linksys router firmware. Amateur programmers quickly learned how to add $600 features to $60 routers. This changed the dynamics of the router market as expectations of both stability and features on the part of consumers increased. Linksys and other vendors then had to respond, since open source firmware is now freely available for licensing and customization, which would enable new router vendors to enter the market without the traditional barrier of having to develop the firmware code. The best consumer routers are now arguably comparable to what were formerly high-end routers.

High-Definition Multimedia Interface is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data. It represents a digital alternative to consumer analog standards, such as radio frequency (RF) coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video, SCART, component video, D-Terminal, and VGA. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources—such as set-top boxes, Blu-ray Disc players, personal computers (PCs), video game consoles (such as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), and AV receivers—to compatible digital audio devices, computer monitors, and digital televisions.
<br><br>
HDMI supports, on a single cable, any TV or PC video format, including standard, enhanced, and high-definition video; up to 8 channels of digital audio; and a Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) connection. The CEC allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one remote control handset. Because HDMI is electrically compatible with the signals used by Digital Visual Interface (DVI), no signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. As an uncompressed connection, HDMI is independent of the various digital television standards used by individual devices, such as ATSC and DVB, as these are encapsulations of compressed MPEG video streams (which can be decoded and output as an uncompressed video stream on HDMI). HDMI products started shipping in the autumn of 2003.
<br><br>
There are four HDMI connector types. Type A and Type B are defined in the HDMI 1.0 specification, Type C is defined in the HDMI 1.3 specification, and Type D is defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification.

<td>Google began as a research project in 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Ph.D. students at Stanford. They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationships between websites would produce better results than existing techniques (which ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page). In 2000 Google began selling advertisements associated with the search keyword to produce enhanced search results for the user. While the company does not provide detailed information about its hardware, a 2006 estimate consisted of over 450,000 servers, racked up in clusters located in data centers around the world. According to the Nielsen cabinet, Google is the first search engine on the web with a 54% market share, ahead of Yahoo! (23%) and MSN (13%). Google registers about a billion requests per day.

The whole software suite of PeopleSoft moved from the traditional client-server based design to web-centric design. The end result was that all of a company's business functions could be accessed and run on a web client on any database. 
In 2003, PeopleSoft performed a friendly merger with smaller rival J.D. Edwards software who provided similar services to small and mid sized businesses. J.D. Edwards product architecture is also designed to shield applications from both the operating system and database of the backend servers.<br>

Oracle made a hostile corporate takeover attempt. The U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block Oracle, on the grounds that the acquisition would break anti-trust laws; however, in September 2004, the suit was rejected by a U.S. Federal judge, who found that the Justice Department had not proven its anti-trust case; in October, the same decision was handed down by the European Commission. Oracle will change the old products into their new product &quot;Fusion&quot;, saying that fusion will take the best aspects of the PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Oracle Applications and merge them into a new product suite.

With reasonable video and audio bit-rate settings (a resolution of 320×240, a video bit rate of 500 Kb per second, and an audio sampling rate of 22050 kHz) a 22 minute video file is roughly 55 MB, enough to fit on a Memory Stick Duo as small as a 64 MB. At the same rate, a hundred-minute feature film can fit on a 256 MB Memory Stick. 
<p>
The PlayStation Portable can connect to a wireless network through Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11b which allows it to surf the web via the built-in Access Co. NetFront browser and connect to other PlayStation Portable units for multiplayer gaming world-wide. The Playstation Portable holds the unique distinction of being the first game console to launch with games supporting online gameplay.  Ad-hoc wireless networking allows for up to 16 PlayStation Portables within range to communicate directly to each other (typically for multiplayer gaming). One unit acts as the host for a game, which is available to other PlayStation Portable units within that system's range, and appears in a list when the client PlayStation Portable searches for available hosts. One can also use an Ad-Hoc network to send images from one PlayStation Portable to another by use of the "send" and "receive" functions that appear in the "PHOTO" menu.

Techniques for the asynchronous loading of content on an existing web page without requiring a full reload date back to Internet Explorer 3 in 1996. Macromedia's Flash 4 could also, from version 4, load XML and CSV files from a remote server without requiring a browser refresh. Microsoft then created the XMLHttpRequest object in Internet Explorer version 5 and first took advantage of these techniques using XmlHttpRequest in Outlook Web Access supplied with the Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 release. In 2002, a user-community modification to Microsoft Remote Scripting was made to replace the Java applet with XMLHttpRequest, which is currently at the heart of the Ajax technique.</td></table>

Extended Memory 64-bit Technology (EM64T) is Intel's implementation of AMD64, a 64-bit extension to the IA-32 architecture, in direct competition with their own failing IA-64 architecture. Intel announced that their first dual-core EM64T processors will ship in the second quarter 2005 with the release of the Pentium Extreme Edition 840 and the new Pentium D chips. Analysts have speculated that the clock rate race between Intel and AMD is largely over, with no more exponential gains in clock rate looking likely. Instead, as long as Moore's Law holds up, it is expected that the increasing numbers of transistors that chip-makers can incorporate into their CPUs will be used to increase CPU throughput in other ways, such as by adding cores, as the Pentium D does.

Advertising emphasizes the iPod nano's small size: it is 1.6 inches (40 mm) wide, 3.5 inches (90 mm) long, 0.27 inches (6.9 mm) thick and weighs 1.5 ounces (42 grams).

The iPod nano uses flash memory instead of a hard disk. As a result, it has no significant moving parts (excluding the click wheel), making it immune to skipping and far more durable than disk-based players. The tradeoff is flash memory has a finite number of read/write cycles, and is more expensive.

MySpace is a social networking website offering user-submitted network of friends, personal profiles, blogs, groups, photos, music, and videos. MySpace also features an internal search engine and an internal e-mail system. Nothing new there, but by 2006 for some bizarre reason, mySpace skyrockets the pack by creating it's 100 millionth account, making it the number 1 social network by far, and the site reportedly attracts new registrations at a rate of 230,000 per day, which is beyond any other web site service in the world. 
<br><br>
MySpace allows users to modify their user pages. Although JavaScript is not allowed, HTML/XHTML and CSS can be used to change the vast majority of the profile to the user's preference. Users also have the option to add embedded music into their profiles via MySpace Music, a service that allows bands to post songs onto their respective profiles. Videos, flash-based content, and almost anything else can be added, much like a standard HTML page. Since many users of MySpace do not know HTML, third-party code generating websites have appeared to help these users. As of 2006, The company's servers are all running Microsoft IIS 6.0 on the Windows Server 2003 OS. The company employs 300 staff and is owned by News Corporation.

WikiLeaks is an international non-profit journalistic organisation that publishes secret information, news leaks, and classified media from anonymous sources. Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland by the organisation Sunshine Press, claimed a database of more than 1.2 million documents within a year of its launch. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder, editor-in-chief, and director. Kristinn Hrafnsson, Joseph Farrell, and Sarah Harrison are the only other publicly known and acknowledged associates of Julian Assange.
<p>
Assange was being examined separately by "several government agencies" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI. Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was still under "active and ongoing" investigation at that time. Moreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the "2010 Manhunting Timeline", and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. In the same documents there was a proposal by the NSA to designate WikiLeaks as a "malicious foreign actor", thus increasing the surveillance against it.
<p>
On 26 January 2015, WikiLeaks revealed that three members of the organisation received notice that "Google had handed over all their emails and metadata to the United States government". In the notifications, there was the list of possible charges that originated the warrant to Google and that the secret grand jury intends to use against WikiLeaks and likely Assange too. They were espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, theft or conversion of property belonging to the United States government, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and general conspiracy. They carry up to a minimum of 45 years in prison, if they amount to one charge per these five types; otherwise, even more years could be added.
The United States investigation confirmed its ongoing proceedings against WikiLeaks in a 15 December 2015 court submission.

BioBrick parts are DNA sequences which conform to a restriction-enzyme assembly standard. These building blocks are used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts and combinations of parts with defined functions, which would then be incorporated into living cells such as Escherichia coli cells to construct new biological systems.
<p>
The BioBricks Foundation was formed in 2006 by engineers and scientists alike as a not-for-profit organization to standardize biological parts across the field. The Foundation focuses on improving in areas of Technology, Law, Education and the Global Community as they apply to synthetic biology. 
<p>
The BioBrick assembly standard was introduced to overcome the lack of standardization posed by traditional molecular cloning methods. The BioBrick assembly standard is a more reliable approach for combining parts to form larger composites. The assembly standard enables two groups of synthetic biologists in different parts of the world to re-use a BioBrick part without going through the whole cycle of design and manipulation. This means the newly designed part can be used by other teams of researchers more easily. Besides that, when compared to the old-fashioned ad hoc cloning method, the assembly standard process is faster and promotes automation.

The new speed ratings go up to 90 MB/s.
<p>
SDXC adopts Microsoft's exFAT file system as a mandatory feature, the use of which is governed by a proprietary license, thereby limiting its legal availability. Windows Vista (SP1 and later) and OS X (10.6.5 and later) support exFAT out of the box. Windows XP and Server 2003 can support exFAT via an optional update from Microsoft. Most BSD and Linux distributions do not support exFAT for legal reasons. BSD/Linux users must manually install third-party implementations of exFAT in order to be able to mount exFAT-formatted volumes.

Significantly, Oracle, previously only a software vendor, now owned both hardware and software product lines from Sun (e.g. SPARC Enterprise and Java, respectively). A major issue of the purchase was the fact that Sun was a major competitor to Oracle, raising many concerns among antitrust regulators, open source advocates, customers, and employees. 
<p> 
The EU Commission delayed the acquisition for several months over concerns of Oracle's plans for MySQL, Sun's competitor to the Oracle Database.

Ben Silbermann summarized the company as a "catalog of ideas," rather than as a social network, that inspires users to "go out and do that thing."
<p>
Users can upload, save, sort, and manage images—known as pins—and other media content (e.g., videos) through collections known as pinboards. Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform. Users can browse the content of others in their feed. Users can then save individual pins to one of their own boards using the "Pin It" button, with Pinboards typically organized by a central topic or theme. Users can personalize their experience with Pinterest by pinning items, creating boards, and interacting with other members. The end result is that the "pin feed" of each user displays unique, personalized results.
<p>
In February 2013, Reuters and ComScore stated that Pinterest had 48.7 million users globally. A study released in July 2013 by French social media agency Semiocast revealed the website had 70 million users worldwide.
<p>
In 2014, Pinterest generated its first revenue, when it begins charging advertisers to promote their wares to the site's millions of hobbyists, vacation planners, and do-it-yourselfers. Ads on the site could generate as much as $500 million in 2016, estimates Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.

The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is an underground laboratory near Lead, South Dakota, which houses multiple physics experiments in areas such as dark matter and neutrino research. It was initially planned to be part of the United States Department of Energy's Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) project.
<br><br>
The Homestake mine in South Dakota was a deep underground gold mine located in Lead, South Dakota, and until its closure in 2002 it was the largest and deepest gold mine in North America. Scientific experiments came to the mine in the late 1960s, when the Homestake experiment (also known as Davis experiment) was used by Raymond Davis, Jr. to observe solar neutrinos – this allowed him to discover the solar neutrino problem.
<br><br>
The Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, or DUSEL, was a major project under consideration by the research wings of the United States Department of Energy (DOE). DUSEL was planned to be a series of large laboratories, caverns, and cleanrooms serving the field of underground science. The main impetus for DUSEL was the study of extremely rare nuclear physics processes, like neutrino scattering, dark matter interactions, and neutrinoless double beta decay, which can only be studied in the absence of cosmic rays. (Cosmic ray muons on the Earth's surface cause backgrounds in these types of detectors, but the particles cannot penetrate great depths in rock.) Easy access to these great depths will open new frontiers in geomicrobiology, geosciences, and mining engineering, making DUSEL a multidisciplinary facility.
<br><br>
In 2011, the Department of Energy agreed to fund ongoing research at the Sanford Lab, with the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority operating the lab through the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The first two major experiments sited at the lab were the Large Underground Xenon experiment (LUX) for dark matter research, and MAJORANA, which searches for the rare phenomenon of neutrinoless double beta decay. The installation of the Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical Research (CASPAR) experiment began in August 2015 with the goal of beginning calibration testing by January 2016. The DOE has selected Sanford Lab as the far-detector site for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).

The Five Eyes, often abbreviated as FVEY, is an intelligence alliance that operates with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. Its roots can be traced back to the middle of the 20th century, when the UKUSA Agreement was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States. It later expanded to include Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  The following list includes several notable examples reported in the media:

On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other newspapers including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.
<p>
On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over a month. Russian authorities granted him one-year asylum, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of Linux applications inside software containers. Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.
<p>
Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as aufs and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.
<p>
The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting, including the CPU, memory, block I/O and network. Since version 0.9, Docker includes the libcontainer library as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC (Linux Containers) and systemd-nspawn.
<p>
Operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers, virtualization engines (VEs) or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users. On Unix-like operating systems, this technology can be seen as an advanced implementation of the standard chroot mechanism. In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often provides resource-management features to limit the impact of one container's activities on other containers.

<b>2013: Small Form Factor</b><p>

A small form factor (SFF) is a computer form factor designed to minimize the volume of a desktop computer. For comparison purposes, the size of an SFF case is usually measured in litres. SFFs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including shoeboxes, cubes, and book-sized PCs. Their smaller and often lighter construction has made them popular as home theater PCs and as gaming computers for attending LAN parties. Manufacturers also emphasize the aesthetic and ergonomic design of SFFs since users are more likely to place them on top of a desk or carry them around. Advancements in component technology together with reductions in size means a powerful computer is no longer restricted to the huge towers of old.
<p>
Small form factors do not include computing devices that have traditionally been small, such as embedded or mobile systems. However, "small form factor" lacks a normative definition and is consequently open to interpretation and misuse. Manufacturers often provide definitions that serve the interests of their products. According to marketing strategy, one manufacturer may decide to mark their product as "small form factor", while other manufacturers are using different marketing name (such as "Minitower", "Microtower" or "Desktop") for personal computers of similar or even smaller footprint.

The PlayStation 4 is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It competes with Nintendo's Wii U and Microsoft's Xbox One, as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU they had developed to date. 
<p>
The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and supported Sony Xperia mobile devices ("Remote Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes.
<p>
Reception to the PlayStation 4 prior to launch was positive, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embrace of independent game development, and for not imposing restrictive digital rights management schemes that Microsoft had previously announced for Xbox One prior to its release. Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as being "significant" and "obvious". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. As of June 30, 2016, more than 43 million consoles have been shipped worldwide.
<p>
On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled two hardware revisions of PlayStation 4; a slim build of the console, and a "Pro" version with an upgraded GPU and higher CPU clock rate to support 4K gameplay on supported titles. All models, including the original sold in 2013, support HDR10 high-dynamic-range color.

It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", which competed against other digital media players, such as the Apple TV and Google TV platforms.
<p>
Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing and the integration of entertainment applications and services, offering the ability to overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide, split-screen multitasking of applications, and improved second-screen support. The console optionally includes a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition for use in its graphical user interface (GUI) and games. The Xbox One offers the ability for users to record and share "clips" from gameplay or live-stream directly to Twitch, Ustream, and other streaming platforms. The console's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback.

The two drives aren't directly comparable, though, as the Samsung unit is a standard size 2.5 inch SSD and the new Seagate drive uses the 3.5 inch hard drive form factor. Despite that, Seagate still claims that its drive has twice the density of Samsung. I don't think the maths quite work out, considering a 3.5 inch drive has a far greater volume than a 2.5 inch drive, but Seagate is probably referring to the density of the memory chips themselves.
