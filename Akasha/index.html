</b> "AKASHA" is the all pervasive space of the universe. "Akashic
Records" Are the master records of everything that has ever
occurred since the beginning of the universe. Since I have no idea
how big this site will get, or what I'll put in it, I figured why
not call it something all encompassing? There is more about the
Hindu &amp; Buddhists ideas behind the word Akasha listed here.</p>
