<b>PC</b> 
(Personal Computer) Although the term PC is sometimes used to refer to any kind of 
personal computer (Mac, Amiga, etc.), in general, PC refers to computers that conform 
to the PC standard originally developed by IBM. PCs are used as stand-alone personal computers 
or as workstations and file servers in a LAN (local area network). They run under Windows. 
If an Intel-based PC is used as a server running UNIX or other operating system, it is typically 
called an Intel-based server, or x86-based server, not a PC.

<p>You can replace floppies, hard disks and video displays, as well as add a scanner, 
CD-ROM or other device because PC components are interchangeable. Expansion cards are plugged 
in and out, and an entire motherboard can be replaced with one from a different vendor. </P>

<b>Power Supply</b><br />
An electrical system that converts AC current from the wall outlet into the DC currents 
required by the computer circuitry. In a personal computer, +5, -5, +12 and -12 voltages are generated. The 5 volts 
are used for the electronic circuitry, and the 12 volts are required for the drives.Fortunately, power supplies usually 
come preinstalled with the PC case and are standardized between Desktop and Laptop PCs, so you will probably never have 
to choose between power supplies. Below are a few things to look for in the Powersupply: </P>

<b>EMI </b> Electro Magnetic Interference<br />
<b>Fan Rating -</b> Airflow rated in cubic feet per minute<br />
<b>Hold-up time - </b>Time period that a power supply's output will remain within specified limits, following power 
disturbances or a loss of input power.<br />
<b>Load regulation</b> - Change in output voltage due to a varying load.<br />
<b>Line regulation</b> - Change in output voltage due to varying input voltage.<br />
<b>MTBF - </b>Mean Time Between Failure.<br />
<b>Noise -</b> Loudness<br />
<b>Operating temperature - </b>Range of temperatures a power supply can be safely operated.<br />
<b>Overvoltage protection - </b>Shuts down the power supply if the output voltage exceeds a specified limit.<br />
