Biography
<br><br>
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby &quot;Him&quot; was originally an artificial human born from a cocoon (a virgin birth in all but name), but was later rechristened and evolved to higher being status by the High Evolutionary and set up as the Messiah-like protector of Counter-Earth. The very first splash page image of Warlock was Gil Kaneâ€™s take on the Crucifixion (Marvel Premiere #1). <br>

Apparently, Roy Thomas, the main architect of the re-imagined Adam Warlock, was a fan of the Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It was a bold, if not entirely successful, attempt to do something a little bit different in comics.
