Biography
<br><br>
Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby &quot;Him&quot; was originally an artificial human created by the group of researchers who called themselves the Beehive.
</p><p> 
He promptly encountered Thor, and attempted the abduction of the Lady Sif in order to mate with her. Thor naturally took offense to this kidnapping, and promptly beat the young Godling near to death. Him promptly retreated to the safety of a regenerative cocoon and thus was later reborn.
</p><p>
Born from a cocoon (a virgin birth in all but name), he was later rechristened and evolved to higher being status by the High Evolutionary who also gave him the vampiric Soul Gem. and set up as the Messiah-like protector of Counter-Earth. The very first splash page image of Warlock was Gil Kaneâ€™s take on the Crucifixion (Marvel Premiere #1). <br>

Apparently, Roy Thomas, the main architect of the re-imagined Adam Warlock, was a fan of the Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It was a bold, if not entirely successful, attempt to do something a little bit different in comics.
