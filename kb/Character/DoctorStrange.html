Biography:
</p><p>
Dr. Stephen Strange, M.D. is a selfish doctor who only cares about wealth from his career. After a car accident shatters the bones in his hands, he is unable to perform surgery when his hands begin to tremble uncontrollably. Too vain to take on a teaching job, Strange desperately searches for a way to restore his hands.
</p><p>
After he exhausts his funds, he becomes a drifter. Depressed and still searching, Strange, while walking near the docks, overhears two sailors talking about a hermit called the Ancient One (who is actually the Earth's Sorcerer Supreme) in the Himalayas, who can cure any ailment. Strange uses the last of his funds to seek out the aged mystic. The Ancient One refuses to help Strange because of his arrogance, but senses a good side that he attempts to bring to the surface. He fails, but Strange's heroism appears when he discovers the Ancient One's disciple, Baron Mordo, attempting to kill the old man. 
</p><p>
After a confrontation with Mordo leads to him being shackled with restraining spells preventing him from either attacking Mordo or warning the Ancient One, Strange desperately and selflessly accepts the Ancient One's offer to become his apprentice to have some hope of helping the old man. The Ancient One, pleased at Strange's sincere change of heart, accepts the westerner and promptly frees him from the restraining spells while explaining he was aware of Mordo's treachery all along. 
</p><p>
Strange soon becomes Mordo's most enduring enemy, as the Ancient One teaches the doctor the mystic arts. After completing his training, Strange returns to New York City and takes up residence within the Sanctum Sanctorum, a townhouse located in Greenwich Village, and is soon assisted by his personal servant Wong.
