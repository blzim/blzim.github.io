Jurassic Park is an American science fiction media franchise centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs who escape confinement and rampage on the human characters. It began in 1990 when Universal Studios bought the rights to the novel by Michael Crichton before it was even published.
</p><p>
The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation, which led to three sequels, although the third and fourth films were not based on novels as the first two were. Numerous video games based on the franchise have been created by various software developers since the release of the 1993 film.

The fourth film, Jurassic World, was initially scheduled to be released in the summer of 2005, but was delayed numerous times and was ultimately released in June 2015. It became the first film that grossed over $500 million worldwide in its opening weekend, and has grossed over $1.67 billion through the course of its theatrical run, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of all time.

When adjusted for monetary inflation, however, this film is the second highest grossing in the franchise after Jurassic Park. An animated film, Lego Jurassic World: The Indominus Escape, was released on October 18, 2016 with the home media release of Jurassic World, alongside a short film, Employee Safety Video.
</p><p>
A fifth film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is scheduled for a June 22, 2018, release date. As of 2000, the franchise had generated $5 billion in revenue, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.
