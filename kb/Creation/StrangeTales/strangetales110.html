<p>
The Human Torch Vs. the Wizard and Paste-Pot Pete!: After a training session the Human Torch goes over his scrap book of past adventures, and recalls his previous battles against the Wizard and Paste Pot Pete, wondering what his old foes are up to today. Coincidentally enough, at that very moment Paste Pot Pete is busy breaking the Wizard out of prison so that the two may conspire on how to defeat their mutual foe.
</p><p> 
Using the Wizard's suit that mimics the Human Torch's powers, the two begin to commit crimes that would cause the press to accuse the Human Torch of being a spy. However, when the Torch sets a trap to lure the two crooks to try and rob one of the world's richest men, the Torch himself gets captured and placed into a giant hall of mirrors by his foes. The Torch uses his flame powers to break free and manages to capture the two crooks and turn them over to the police.
