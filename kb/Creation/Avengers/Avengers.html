Series: on-going with multiple braches and restarts.<br>

Publisher: 1963-current Marvel<br>

The 1963 series (#1-402) ran until 1996. It started again at #1 in 1998, but then switched back to the original numbering at #85 to show that it was the 500th issue if the original numbering remained.

In 1960, DC Comics launched a comic book series featuring a team of superheroes called the Justice League. Impressed by that book's strong sales, Martin Goodman, the owner of Marvel Comics predecessor Timely Comics, asked Stan Lee to create a title featuring a similar team of superheroes for Marvel.
</p><p>
Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of pre-existing superhero characters created by Lee and Jack Kirby. Between 1996 and 2004, Marvel relaunched the primary Avengers title three times.
</p><p>
The Avengers vol. 2 was written by Rob Liefeld and penciled by Jim Valentino, and ran for 13 issues (Nov. 1996–Nov. 1997). The final issue, which featured a crossover with the other Heroes Reborn titles, returned the characters to the main Marvel Universe.
</p><p>
The Avengers vol. 3 relaunched and ran for 84 issues from February 1998 to August 2004. To coincide with what would have been the 500th issue of the original series, Marvel changed the numbering, and The Avengers #500-503 (Sept.– Dec. 2004), the one-shot Avengers Finale (Jan. 2005) became the "Avengers Disassembled" storyline and final issues. 
</p><p>
Avengers vol. 4 debuted in July 2010 and ran until January 2013. Vol. 5 was launched in February 2013. After Secret Wars, a new Avengers team debuted, dubbed the All-New, All-Different Avengers.
</p><p>
The roster changed almost immediately after the first issue; at the beginning of the second issue, Ant-Man became Giant-Man, and at the end of the issue, the Hulk quit the team. Issue #4 brought the title's first major milestone: the revival and return of Captain America.
</p><p>
The creative team of writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema introduced new characters such as Arkon in issue #75 (April 1970) and Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970). The team's adventures increased in scope as the team crossed into an alternate dimension and battled the Squadron Supreme, and fought in the Kree-Skrull War, which guest-starred the Kree hero, Captain Marvel. Novelist Harlan Ellison plotted two stories for the series. The first ("The Summons of Psyklop") was published in issue #88 (1971) and the second ("Five Dooms to Save Tomorrow") in #101 (1972)
