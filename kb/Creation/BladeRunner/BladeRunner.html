In the not too distant future, mankind lives side-by-side with synthetic lifeforms known as replicants. These androids serve the human race in many different helpful capacities. Every now and then, these androids malfunction and threaten human lives. When that happens, special bounty-hunters known as Blade Runners are called in to deal with the situation.

Of all the Blade Runners Rick Deckard was the best. Now he is being forced out of retirement to deal with a gang of especially dangerous replicants. If Deckard survives this last case one thing is for sure, his life will never be the same again.
