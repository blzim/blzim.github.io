Story: Worse Thing Waiting<br>
Born to a young woman driven to insanity and black magic by the deaths of her previous children, the 13th Son is a creature like nothing this world has seen before. Humans are not his target. It's the other monsters who walk this world, the Wendigo, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, and vampires who live in fear of his enormous and terrifying powers. And what those powers are setting into motion is a horror beyond your deepest, darkest nightmares.
</p><p>
The tale opens with a group of monsters sitting around and basically telling a campfire tale of the one thing they fear more than anything else...The 13th Son, the monster that hunts monsters! Some think that his existence is merely a monster urban legend but they soon find out how wrong they are as the 13th Son pounces on them, tearing them apart almost effortlessly. Then the creature gets a visitor...an animated skeleton who informs him that his "mother" wishes to see him. There's no love lost between mother and son, as the old crone demands he love her like a true son and the monster wants nothing to do with her.

The monster's background is recounted...In the late 1600's, A Puritan woman and her husband tried to have children, yet each child failed to survive. Then, finally, the 13th child lived, a misshapen creature that her husband sought to drown. She killed her husband to protect her baby but later cursed him when he left and now seeks revenge by conjuring up another son to destroy him. His father Elijah crawls out of the muck, a rotting corpse, but bent on retribution against his wife. The 13th Son and his own wife are now set to give birth to their own child...the 13th son of a 13th son!
