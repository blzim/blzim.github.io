<b>2000: Smartphones</b>
<table><td><img src="pics20002020/2000_smartphone.jpg"></td><td>
A smartphone is a mobile phone with an advanced mobile operating system which combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. 
<br>
<br>
Smartphones have cell phone featues, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and text messages, and features of a computer, such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital still and video cameras, web browsers, and email. They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers 70% or more of the front surface. The display is often a touchscreen, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate user programs. Communication occurs over mobile broadband with data choices of either mobile broadband or local Wi-Fi.
<br>
<br>
The Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones which accumulated an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide. Worldwide shipments of smartphones topped 1 billion units in 2013.

<img src="pics20002020/2000_Y2K.gif" border=0></td>
<td> With a little preparation, turns out not to be the end of the world after all. It was speculated that computer programs could stop working or produce erroneous results because they stored years with only two digits and that the year 2000 would be represented by 00 and would be interpreted by software as the year 1900. This would cause date comparisons to produce incorrect results. It was also thought that embedded systems, making use of similar date logic, might fail and cause utilities and other crucial infrastructure to fail.<br>
<br>
Special committees were set up by governments to monitor remedial work and contingency planning, particularly by crucial infrastructures such as telecommunications, utilities and the like, to ensure that the most critical services had fixed their own problems and were prepared for problems with others. It was only the safe passing of the main "event horizon" itself, January 1, 2000, that fully quelled public fears.

(NT 5.0) Microsoft continues to improve the NT line.Windows 2000 comes in four versions: Professional, Server, Advanced Server, and Datacenter Server. Windows 2000 is classified as a hybrid-kernel operating system, and its architecture is divided into two modes: user mode and kernel mode. The kernel mode provides unrestricted access to system resources and facilitates the user mode, which is heavily restricted and designed for most applications. <br>
<br>
All versions of the operating system support the Windows NT filesystem, NTFS 5, the Encrypted File System (EFS), as well as basic and dynamic disk storage. Dynamic disk storage allows different types of volumes to be used. The Windows 2000 Server family has enhanced functionality, including the ability to provide Active Directory services (a hierarchical framework of resources), Distributed File System (a file system that supports sharing of files) and fault-redundant storage volumes.

<b>Floating Gate Transistor</b>
<p>
<img src="pics20002020/2000_FloatingGateTransistor.png"></td><td>
USB flash drives are NAND-type flash memory data storage devices integrated with a USB interface. They are typically small, lightweight, removable and rewritable. As of November 2006, memory capacities for USB Flash Drives currently are sold from 32 megabytes up to 64 gigabytes.
<br>
<br>
USB flash drives offer potential advantages over other portable storage devices, particularly the floppy disk. They are more compact, generally 
faster, hold more data, and may be more reliable (due to their lack of moving parts) than floppy disks. 
<br>
<br>
IBM was the first North American seller of a USB flash drive, and marketed an 8 MB version of the product in 2001 under the "Memory Key" moniker. Lexar can also lay claim to a pioneering USB flash drive product. In 2000 they introduced a Compact Flash (CF) card having an internal USB function.
<br>
<br>
But the technology behind devices like Flash Memory cards and USB Flash Drives come from Flash Memory, which was invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka while working for Toshiba in 1984. According to Toshiba, the name 'Flash' was suggested by Dr. Masuoka's colleague, Mr. Shoji Ariizumi, because the erasure process of the memory contents reminded him of a flash of a camera.
<br>
<br>
There are two types of Flash memory, NOR and NAND. NAND is the common form found in devices like memory cards, USB Flash drives, audio players, digital cameras, video games, PDAs and mobile Phones. 
<br>
<br>
In a computer, working memory is placed in RAM, which allows the information to be randomly accessed, but will lose the information without a steady flow of electricity, so changes are saved into long term memory storage, which is usually on a hard drive or CD. Flash memory has the ability to allow random access like RAM, yet is a form of non-volatile storage, meaning it does not require a steady stream of electricity.
<br>
<br>
Flash memory stores information in an array of floating gate transistors, called "cells", each of which traditionally stores one bit of information. 
<br>
<br>
Newer flash memory devices, sometimes referred to as multi-level cell devices, can store more than 1 bit per cell, by using more than two levels of electrical charge, placed on the floating gate of a cell.
<br>
<br>
In a Floating Gate Transistor, oxide surrounds the floating gate entirely, so an electrical charge trapped on the floating gate remains there. The charge stored on the floating gate can be modified by applying voltages to the source, drain, and control gate terminals. This is what keeps the memory state when the power is off.
<br>
<br>
Standard computer RAM is currently much faster than Flash, or any other ROM, but work is in place to create Flash memory that is as fast as RAM. ROM technology like Flash goes back many years, but 2000 is definately the year that USB Flash Drives began popping up all over the place. As of 2016 1TB capacity has been released with no end in sight.

Data Domain was an Information Technology company from 2001 to 2009 specializing in target-based deduplication solutions for disk based backup. Since its acquisition by EMC Corporation in 2009, Data Domain systems have been EMC's flagship protection storage platform for backup, archive, and disaster recovery.
<p>
Data Domain was founded by Kai Li, Ben Zhu, and Brian Biles. Chief Architect Hugo Patterson joined 3 months after initial funding. The goal of the company was to minimize the tape automation market with a disk-based substitute. It did this by inventing a very fast implementation of lossless data compression, optimized for streaming workloads, which compares incoming large data segments against all others stored in its multi-TB store. Originally categorized as "capacity optimization" by industry analysts, it later became more widely known as inline "data deduplication".

<img src="pics20002020/2002_net.jpg"></td><td>
Microsoft releases .NET web services development platform.Programs written for the .NET framework execute in a software environment that manages the program's runtime requirements. This runtime environment, which is also a part of the .NET framework, is known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR provides the appearance of an application virtual machine, so that programmers need not consider the capabilities of the specific CPU that will execute the program. The CLR also provides other important services such as security guarantees, memory management, and exception handling.<br>
<br>
The class library and the CLR together comprise the .NET framework. The framework is intended to make it easier to develop computer applications and to reduce the vulnerability of applications and computers to security threats. First released in 2002, it is included with current versions of Microsoft Windows, and can be installed on most older versions.

<img src="pics20002020/2002_vsNet.png"></td><td>
Microsoft released Visual Studio .NET in 2002 (the beta version was released on the Microsoft developer network in 2001). The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the .NET Framework. Programs developed using .NET are not compiled to machine language (like C++ is, for example) but instead to a format called MSIL or CIL. When an MSIL application is executed, it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine language for the platform it is being executed on, thereby making code portable across multiple platforms. Programs compiled into MSIL can be executed only on platforms which have an implementation of Common Language Infrastructure. It is possible to run MSIL programs in Linux or Mac OS X using non-Microsoft .NET implementations like Mono and DotGNU.<br>
<br>
Microsoft introduced C#, a new programming language, that targets .NET. It also introduced the successor to Visual J++ called Visual J#. Visual J# programs use Java's language syntax. However, unlike Visual J++ programs, Visual J# programs can only target the .NET Framework, not the Java Virtual Machine that all other Java tools target.<br>
<br>
Visual Basic was drastically changed to fit the new framework, and the new version was called Visual Basic .NET. Microsoft also added extensions to C++, called Managed Extensions for C++, so that C++ programmers could create .NET programs.<br>
<br>
Visual Studio .NET can be used to make applications targeting Windows (using Windows Forms, part of the .NET Framework), Web (using ASP.NET and Web Services) and, with an add-in, portable devices (using the .NET Compact Framework).

<img src="pics20002020/2003Sata.jpg"></td>
<td>Serial  ATA is a computer bus technology primarily designed for transfer of data to and from a hard disk. It is the successor to Advanced Technology Attachment standard (ATA). This older technology was retroactively renamed Parallel ATA (PATA) to distinguish it from Serial ATA. Both SATA and PATA drives are IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics) drives, although IDE is often misused to indicate PATA drives. 
<br>
<br>
SATA drives are hot plugable and use smaller power and interfact cables. Unlike PATA, SATA drives cannot share the bus, so each device has a dedicated cable and bandwidth.
<br>
<br>
SATA drives may be plugged into Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) controllers and communicate on the same physical cable as native SAS disks. SAS disks, however, may not be plugged into a SATA controller.
<br>
<br>
First-generation SATA interfaces, also known as SATA/150 or SATA 1, run at 1.5 gigabits per second (Gbit/s), but uses encoding at the physical layer, resulting in an actual data transfer rate of 1.2 Gbit/s, or 150 megabytes per second (MB/s). The relative simplicity of a serial link 
and the use of LVDS allow both the use of longer drive cables and an easier transition path to higher speeds.
<br>
<br>
Second generation SATA is known as SATA 3.0 Gbit/s, and runs at 2.4 Gbit/s or 300MB/s. The new controllers maintain backwards compatiblity with original SATA devices.
<br>
<br>
External SATA is commonly called eSATA. Currently, most PC motherboards do not have an eSATA connector. eSATA may be enabled through 
<br>
<br>
the addition of an eSATA host bus adapter (HBA) or bracket connector for desktop systems or with a Cardbus or ExpressCard for notebooks.

<img src="pics20002020/2003_linksysCisco.gif"></td><td>
One notable result of Cisco buying Linksys was the WRT54G router. To minimize costs, Linksys decided to base the firmware on Linux. In 2003, Columbia Law School Professor Eben Moglen pointed out that due to the Linux-based nature of the firmware, Cisco was legally obliged to release the source code to the routers, under the terms of the Linux GNU General Public License. Cisco acknowledged its obligation, released the code, and revealed the secrets of how the software code interfaced to the hardware.<br>
<br>
This subsequently spawned an open source community, dedicated to modding Linksys router firmware. Amateur programmers quickly learned how to add $600 features to $60 routers. This changed the dynamics of the router market as expectations of both stability and features on the part of consumers increased. Linksys and other vendors then had to respond, since open source firmware is now freely available for licensing and customization, which would enable new router vendors to enter the market without the traditional barrier of having to develop the firmware code. The best consumer routers are now arguably comparable to what were formerly high-end routers.

High-Definition Multimedia Interface is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data. It represents a digital alternative to consumer analog standards, such as radio frequency (RF) coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video, SCART, component video, D-Terminal, and VGA. HDMI connects digital audio/video sources such as set-top boxes, Blu-ray Disc players, personal computers (PCs), video game consoles (such as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), and AV receivers to compatible digital audio devices, computer monitors, and digital televisions.
<br><br>
HDMI supports, on a single cable, any TV or PC video format, including standard, enhanced, and high-definition video; up to 8 channels of digital audio; and a Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) connection. The CEC allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one remote control handset. Because HDMI is electrically compatible with the signals used by Digital Visual Interface (DVI), no signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. As an uncompressed connection, HDMI is independent of the various digital television standards used by individual devices, such as ATSC and DVB, as these are encapsulations of compressed MPEG video streams (which can be decoded and output as an uncompressed video stream on HDMI). HDMI products started shipping in the autumn of 2003.
<br><br>
There are four HDMI connector types. Type A and Type B are defined in the HDMI 1.0 specification, Type C is defined in the HDMI 1.3 specification, and Type D is defined in the HDMI 1.4 specification.

They hypothesized that a search engine that analyzed the relationships between websites would produce better results than existing techniques (which ranked results according to how many times the search term appeared on a page). In 2000 Google began selling advertisements associated with the search keyword to produce enhanced search results for the user. While the company does not provide detailed information about its hardware, a 2006 estimate consisted of over 450,000 servers, racked up in clusters located in data centers around the world. According to the Nielsen cabinet, Google is the first search engine on the web with a 54% market share, ahead of Yahoo! (23%) and MSN (13%). Google registers about a billion requests per day.

The PlayStation Portable can connect to a wireless network through Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11b which allows it to surf the web via the built-in Access Co. NetFront browser and connect to other PlayStation Portable units for multiplayer gaming world-wide. The Playstation Portable holds the unique distinction of being the first game console to launch with games supporting online gameplay.  Ad-hoc wireless networking allows for up to 16 PlayStation Portables within range to communicate directly to each other (typically for multiplayer gaming). One unit acts as the host for a game, which is available to other PlayStation Portable units within that system's range, and appears in a list when the client PlayStation Portable searches for available hosts. One can also use an Ad-Hoc network to send images from one PlayStation Portable to another by use of the "send" and "receive" functions that appear in the "PHOTO" menu.

Techniques for the asynchronous loading of content on an existing web page without requiring a full reload date back to Internet Explorer 3 in 1996. Macromedia's Flash 4 could also, from version 4, load XML and CSV files from a remote server without requiring a browser refresh. Microsoft then created the XMLHttpRequest object in Internet Explorer version 5 and first took advantage of these techniques using XmlHttpRequest in Outlook Web Access supplied with the Microsoft Exchange Server 2000 release. In 2002, a user-community modification to Microsoft Remote Scripting was made to replace the Java applet with XMLHttpRequest, which is currently at the heart of the Ajax technique.</td></table>

Extended Memory 64-bit Technology (EM64T) is Intel's implementation of AMD64, a 64-bit extension to the IA-32 architecture, in direct competition with their own failing IA-64 architecture. Intel announced that their first dual-core EM64T processors will ship in the second quarter 2005 with the release of the Pentium Extreme Edition 840 and the new Pentium D chips. Analysts have speculated that the clock rate race between Intel and AMD is largely over, with no more exponential gains in clock rate looking likely. Instead, as long as Moore's Law holds up, it is expected that the increasing numbers of transistors that chip-makers can incorporate into their CPUs will be used to increase CPU throughput in other ways, such as by adding cores, as the Pentium D does.

The iPod nano uses flash memory instead of a hard disk. As a result, it has no significant moving parts (excluding the click wheel), making it immune to skipping and far more durable than disk-based players. The tradeoff is flash memory has a finite number of read/write cycles, and is more expensive.

Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a point-to-point serial protocol that moves data to and from computer-storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. SAS replaces the older Parallel SCSI (Parallel Small Computer System Interface, usually pronounced "scuzzy") bus technology that first appeared in the mid-1980s. 
</p><p>
SAS, like its predecessor, uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers optional compatibility with Serial ATA (SATA), versions 2 and later. This allows the connection of SATA drives to most SAS backplanes or controllers. The reverse, connecting SAS drives to SATA backplanes, is not possible.
</p><p>
Maximum number of devices is 65,535, the speed depends on the version. SAS-1: 3 Gbit/s (2005), SAS-2: 6 Gbit/s (2009), SAS-3: 12 Gbit/s (2013), SAS-4: 22.5 Gbit/s (2017).
</p><p>
A SAS Domain is the SAS version of a SCSI domain—it consists of a set of SAS devices that communicate with one another by means of a service delivery subsystem. Each SAS port in a SAS domain has a SCSI port identifier that identifies the port uniquely within the SAS domain, the World Wide Name. 
</p><p>
It is assigned by the device manufacturer, like an Ethernet device's MAC address, and is typically worldwide unique as well. SAS devices use these port identifiers to address communications to each other.
</p><p>
In addition, every SAS device has a SCSI device name, which identifies the SAS device uniquely in the world. One doesn't often see these device names because the port identifiers tend to identify the device sufficiently.
</p><p>
For comparison, in parallel SCSI, the SCSI ID is the port identifier and device name. In Fibre Channel, the port identifier is a WWPN and the device name is a WWNN.
</p><p>
SAS works inside and outside of the system and has a variety of connector and cable types.

WikiLeaks is an international non-profit journalistic organisation that publishes secret information, news leaks, and classified media from anonymous sources. Its website, initiated in 2006 in Iceland by the organisation Sunshine Press, claimed a database of more than 1.2 million documents within a year of its launch. Julian Assange, an Australian Internet activist, is generally described as its founder, editor-in-chief, and director. Kristinn Hrafnsson, Joseph Farrell, and Sarah Harrison are the only other publicly known and acknowledged associates of Julian Assange.
<p>
Assange was being examined separately by "several government agencies" in addition to the grand jury, most notably the FBI. Court documents published in May 2014 suggest that Assange was still under "active and ongoing" investigation at that time. Moreover, some Snowden documents published in 2014 show that the United States government put Assange on the "2010 Manhunting Timeline", and in the same period they urged their allies to open criminal investigations into the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks. In the same documents there was a proposal by the NSA to designate WikiLeaks as a "malicious foreign actor", thus increasing the surveillance against it.
<p>
On 26 January 2015, WikiLeaks revealed that three members of the organisation received notice that "Google had handed over all their emails and metadata to the United States government". In the notifications, there was the list of possible charges that originated the warrant to Google and that the secret grand jury intends to use against WikiLeaks and likely Assange too. They were espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, theft or conversion of property belonging to the United States government, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and general conspiracy. They carry up to a minimum of 45 years in prison, if they amount to one charge per these five types; otherwise, even more years could be added.
The United States investigation confirmed its ongoing proceedings against WikiLeaks in a 15 December 2015 court submission.

BioBrick parts are DNA sequences which conform to a restriction-enzyme assembly standard. These building blocks are used to design and assemble larger synthetic biological circuits from individual parts and combinations of parts with defined functions, which would then be incorporated into living cells such as Escherichia coli cells to construct new biological systems.
<p>
The BioBricks Foundation was formed in 2006 by engineers and scientists alike as a not-for-profit organization to standardize biological parts across the field. The Foundation focuses on improving in areas of Technology, Law, Education and the Global Community as they apply to synthetic biology. 
<p>
The BioBrick assembly standard was introduced to overcome the lack of standardization posed by traditional molecular cloning methods. The BioBrick assembly standard is a more reliable approach for combining parts to form larger composites. The assembly standard enables two groups of synthetic biologists in different parts of the world to re-use a BioBrick part without going through the whole cycle of design and manipulation. This means the newly designed part can be used by other teams of researchers more easily. Besides that, when compared to the old-fashioned ad hoc cloning method, the assembly standard process is faster and promotes automation.

<p>
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of electronic cash. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user-to-user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
<p>
Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a <b>blockchain</b>. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
<p>
Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, its high electricity consumption, price volatility, thefts from exchanges, and the possibility that bitcoin is an economic bubble. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.

Users can upload, save, sort, and manage images known as pins and other media content (e.g., videos) through collections known as pinboards. Pinterest acts as a personalized media platform. Users can browse the content of others in their feed. 
</p><p>
Users can then save individual pins to one of their own boards using the "Pin It" button, with Pinboards typically organized by a central topic or theme. Users can personalize their experience with Pinterest by pinning items, creating boards, and interacting with other members. The end result is that the "pin feed" of each user displays unique, personalized results.

The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is an underground laboratory near Lead, South Dakota, which houses multiple physics experiments in areas such as dark matter and neutrino research. It was initially planned to be part of the United States Department of Energy's Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) project.</td>
</table><table><td>
The Homestake mine in South Dakota was a deep underground gold mine located in Lead, South Dakota, and until its closure in 2002 it was the largest and deepest gold mine in North America. Scientific experiments came to the mine in the late 1960s, when the Homestake experiment (also known as Davis experiment) was used by Raymond Davis, Jr. to observe solar neutrinos. This allowed him to discover the solar neutrino problem.
<br><br>
The Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory, or DUSEL, was a major project under consideration by the research wings of the United States Department of Energy (DOE). DUSEL was planned to be a series of large laboratories, caverns, and cleanrooms serving the field of underground science. The main impetus for DUSEL was the study of extremely rare nuclear physics processes, like neutrino scattering, dark matter interactions, and neutrinoless double beta decay, which can only be studied in the absence of cosmic rays. (Cosmic ray muons on the Earth's surface cause backgrounds in these types of detectors, but the particles cannot penetrate great depths in rock.) Easy access to these great depths will open new frontiers in geomicrobiology, geosciences, and mining engineering, making DUSEL a multidisciplinary facility.
<br><br>
In 2011, the Department of Energy agreed to fund ongoing research at the Sanford Lab, with the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority operating the lab through the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The first two major experiments sited at the lab were the Large Underground Xenon experiment (LUX) for dark matter research, and MAJORANA, which searches for the rare phenomenon of neutrinoless double beta decay. The installation of the Compact Accelerator System for Performing Astrophysical Research (CASPAR) experiment began in August 2015 with the goal of beginning calibration testing by January 2016. The DOE has selected Sanford Lab as the far-detector site for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).

The Five Eyes, often abbreviated as FVEY, is an intelligence alliance that operates with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. 
</td></table><ul>
Its roots can be traced back to the middle of the 20th century, when the UKUSA Agreement was jointly enacted by the United Kingdom and the United States. It later expanded to include Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  The following list includes several notable examples reported in the media:
<p>
<li>PRISM Operated by the NSA together with the GCHQ and the ASD</li>
<li>XKeyscore Operated by the NSA with contributions from the ASD and the GCSB</li>
<li>Tempora  Operated by the GCHQ with contributions from the NSA</li>
<li>MUSCULAR  Operated by the GCHQ and the NSA</li>
<li>STATEROOM  Operated by the ASD, CIA, CSEC, GCHQ, and NSA</li>
</p><p>
In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other newspapers including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.
</p><p>
On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over a month. Russian authorities granted him one-year asylum, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.

Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.
<p>
Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux. Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as aufs and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.
</p><p>
The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting, including the CPU, memory, block I/O and network. Since version 0.9, Docker includes the libcontainer library as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC (Linux Containers) and systemd-nspawn.
</p><p>
Operating-system-level virtualization is a server virtualization method in which the kernel of an operating system allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances, instead of just one. Such instances, which are sometimes called containers, software containers, virtualization engines (VEs) or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users. 
</p><p>
On Unix-like operating systems, this technology can be seen as an advanced implementation of the standard chroot mechanism. In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often provides resource-management features to limit the impact of one container's activities on other containers.

<b>2013: Small Form Factor</b>
<p>
<img src="pics20002020/2013_SFF.jpg">
<p>
A small form factor (SFF) is a computer form factor designed to minimize the volume of a desktop computer. For comparison purposes, the size of an SFF case is usually measured in litres. SFFs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes, including shoeboxes, cubes, and book-sized PCs. 
<p>
Their smaller and often lighter construction has made them popular as home theater PCs and as gaming computers for attending LAN parties. Manufacturers also emphasize the aesthetic and ergonomic design of SFFs since users are more likely to place them on top of a desk or carry them around. Advancements in component technology together with reductions in size means a powerful computer is no longer restricted to the huge towers of old.
<p>
Small form factors do not include computing devices that have traditionally been small, such as embedded or mobile systems. However, "small form factor" lacks a normative definition and is consequently open to interpretation and misuse. Manufacturers often provide definitions that serve the interests of their products. According to marketing strategy, one manufacturer may decide to mark their product as "small form factor", while other manufacturers are using different marketing name (such as "Minitower", "Microtower" or "Desktop") for personal computers of similar or even smaller footprint.

The PlayStation 4 is a home video game console developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It competes with Nintendo's Wii U and Microsoft's Xbox One, as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. Moving away from the more complex Cell microarchitecture of its predecessor, the console features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built upon the x86-64 architecture, which can theoretically peak at 1.84 teraflops; AMD stated that it was the "most powerful" APU they had developed to date. 
<p>
The PlayStation 4 places an increased emphasis on social interaction and integration with other devices and services, including the ability to play games off-console on PlayStation Vita and supported Sony Xperia mobile devices ("Remote Play"), the ability to stream gameplay online or to friends, with them controlling gameplay remotely ("Share Play"). The console's controller was also redesigned and improved over the PlayStation 3, with improved buttons and analog sticks, and an integrated touchpad among other changes.
<p>
Reception to the PlayStation 4 prior to launch was positive, with critics praising Sony for acknowledging its consumers' needs, embrace of independent game development, and for not imposing restrictive digital rights management schemes that Microsoft had previously announced for Xbox One prior to its release. Critics and third-party studios also praised the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 in comparison to its competitors; developers described the performance difference between the console and Xbox One as being "significant" and "obvious". Heightened demand also helped Sony top global console sales. As of June 30, 2016, more than 43 million consoles have been shipped worldwide.
<p>
On September 7, 2016, Sony unveiled two hardware revisions of PlayStation 4; a slim build of the console, and a "Pro" version with an upgraded GPU and higher CPU clock rate to support 4K gameplay on supported titles.

Microsoft Makecode is released along with it's webiste makecode.com. Makecode is a Google Scratch Blocks based code editor along with converter to Static TypeScript. Google and the MIT Media Lab’s Scratch Team are collaborating on the development of a new generation of graphical programming blocks, called Scratch Blocks. Scratch Blocks builds on Google’s Blockly technology and the Scratch team’s expertise in designing creative interfaces for young learners. At first glance Makecode looks and acts like Scratch. Makecode can convert between the Scratch block interface and javascript.
</p><p>
Makecode also comes with hardware emulators so you can check that your code will work before uploading to any compatible hardware device.
</p><p>
Devices supported so far include: BBC micro:bit, Adafruit Circuit Playground, Lego Mindstorms EV3, Makewonder Cue Robot,

<b>2018: 30 TB SSD</b></p>
<table><td><img src="pics20002020/2018_Samsung30TBSSD.jpg"></td><td>
Samsung, Intel, Toshiba release 30 TB 2.5 inch Solid State Drives.
<p>
The PM1643 is built from 32 sticks of 1TB NAND flash packages, each of which contains 16 layers of 512Gb V-NAND chips. That’s enough space to hold 5,700 HD movies or roughly 500 days of non-stop video, and offers twice the capacity of the former largest SSD — a 16 terabyte drive also released by Samsung back in March 2016.
</td></table><ul>
Seagate made a bigger 60 terabyte SSD, but that was in the more spacious 3.5-inch form factor, and was “demonstration technology” that doesn’t seem to have ever gone on sale. The new Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) drive offers impressive sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,100MB/s and 1,700 MB/s. That’s about three times as fast as the average SATA SSD you’d find in a consumer desktop or laptop.

<b>2018: 100 TB SSD</b></p>
<table><td><img src="pics20002020/2018_100TBSSD.jpg"></td><td>
Nimbus Data released the 100TB ExaDrive DC100.
<p>
The ExaDrive DC100, which is built around 3D NAND flash, packs the 100TB of storage into the standard 3.5-inch form factor of a regular hard drive, which means that it can act as a plug-and-play replacement for existing server and storage platforms.
</p><p>
But having the world's largest capacity isn't the only accolade the ExaDrive DC100 claims. It's also the world's most energy efficient SSD, drawing as little as 0.1 Watts per TB, which is about 80- to 90-percent lower than the competition.

<b>2018: IBM buys Red Hat</b></p>
<table><td><img src="pics20002020/2018_IbmRedHat.jpg"></td><td>
IBM buys RedHat Linux for $34 billion!
<p>
Red Hat will remain a standalone business unit within IBM, and an IBM spokesperson said that IBM "will remain committed to Red Hat’s open source ethos, its developer community and its open source community relationships." </p>
</td></table><p>
Red Hat will maintain its current leadership team and remain in its current headquarters and facilities. The culture will remain as well—though it's possible IBM and Red Hat may cross-pollinate a bit more than they have in the past.
