The LASER (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light coherently. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography.
<br><br>
Among their many applications, lasers are used in optical disk drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners; DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic and free-space optical communication; laser surgery and skin treatments; cutting and welding materials; military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed; and laser lighting displays in entertainment, to name just a few. 
<br><br>
In modern usage, the term "light" includes electromagnetic radiation of any frequency, not only visible light, hence the terms infrared laser, ultraviolet laser, X-ray laser, gamma-ray laser, and so on.

Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations (PLATO), was the first generalized computer-assisted instruction system. Starting in 1960, it ran on the University of Illinois' ILLIAC I computer. 
<br><br>
By the late 1970s, it supported several thousand graphics terminals distributed worldwide, running on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers. Many modern concepts in multi-user computing were originally developed on PLATO, including forums, message boards, online testing, e-mail, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer games.
<br><br>
PLATO was designed and built by the University of Illinois and functioned for four decades, offering coursework (elementary through university) to UIUC students, local schools, and other universities. 
<br><br>
Courses were taught in a range of subjects, including Latin, chemistry, education, music, and primary mathematics. The system included a number of features useful for pedagogy, including text overlaying graphics, contextual assessment of free-text answers, depending on the inclusion of keywords, and feedback designed to respond to alternative answers.
<br><br>
Rights to market PLATO as a commercial product were licensed by Control Data Corporation (CDC), the manufacturer on whose mainframe computers the PLATO IV system was built. CDC President William Norris planned to make PLATO a force in the computer world, but found that marketing the system was not as easy as hoped. PLATO nevertheless built a strong following in certain markets, and the last production PLATO system did not shut down until 2006, coincidentally just a month after Norris died.

<a name="smt"></a>
<b>1960: Surface Mount Technology</b><br>
<table><td><img src="pics19601980/1960_smt.jpg"></td><td>
Surface-mount technology (SMT) is a method for producing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly onto the surface of printed circuit boards (PCBs). An electronic device so made is called a surface-mount device (SMD). In the industry it has largely replaced the through-hole technology construction method of fitting components with wire leads into holes in the circuit board. Both technologies can be used on the same board, with the through-hole technology used for components not suitable for surface mounting such as large transformers and heat-sinked power semiconductors.
An SMT component is usually smaller than its through-hole counterpart because it has either smaller leads or no leads at all. It may have short pins or leads of various styles, flat contacts, a matrix of solder balls (BGAs), or terminations on the body of the component.
<p>
Surface mounting was originally called "planar mounting". Much of the pioneering work in this technology was by IBM. The design approach first demonstrated by IBM in 1960 in a small-scale computer was later applied in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer used in the Instrument Unit that guided all Saturn IB and Saturn V vehicles. Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be directly soldered to the surface of the PCB. Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of a board became far more common with surface mounting than through-hole mounting, allowing much higher circuit densities. Often only the solder joints hold the parts to the board, in rare cases parts on the bottom or "second" side of the board may be secured with a dot of adhesive to keep components from dropping off inside reflow ovens if the part has a large size or weight. 
<p>
Adhesive is sometimes used to hold SMT components on the bottom side of a board if a wave soldering process is used to solder both SMT and through-hole components simultaneously. Alternatively, SMT and through-hole components can be soldered together without adhesive if the SMT parts are first reflow-soldered, then a selective solder mask is used to prevent the solder holding the parts in place from reflowing and the parts floating away during wave soldering. Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor cost and greatly increasing production rates. SMDs can be one-quarter to one-tenth the size and weight, and one-half to one-quarter the cost of equivalent through-hole parts.

<b>1961: Integrated Circuit</b><br>
<table><td><img src="pics19601980/1961_ic.jpg"></td>
<td>Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments files for patent just days before Robert Noyce of Fairchild to co-invent the integrated circuit. Fairchilds photolithography becomes the clear winner and remains the method of IC manufacture today. Robert Noyce along with Gordon Moore would later found Intel and develop the microprocessor using the same techniques.
<p>
An integrated circuit is a set of electronic circuits on one small plate ("chip") of semiconductor material, normally silicon. This can be made much smaller than a discrete circuit made from independent electronic components. ICs can be made very compact, having up to several billion transistors and other electronic components in an area the size of a human fingernail. The half-pitch between nodes in a circuit has been made smaller as the technology advances; in 2008 it dropped below 100 nanometers, and was reduced to around 14 nanometers in 2014.
<p>
ICs were made possible by experimental discoveries showing that semiconductor devices could perform the functions of vacuum tubes and by mid-20th-century technology advancements in semiconductor device fabrication. The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip was an enormous improvement over the manual assembly of circuits using discrete electronic components. The integrated circuit's mass production capability, reliability and building-block approach to circuit design ensured the rapid adoption of standardized integrated circuits in place of designs using discrete transistors.
<p>
ICs have two main advantages over discrete circuits: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume little power (compared to their discrete counterparts) as a result of the small size and close proximity of the components. As of 2012, typical chip areas range from a few square millimeters to around 450 mm2, with up to 9 million transistors per mm2.
Integrated circuits are used in virtually all electronic equipment today and have revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones, and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the low cost of ICs.

<b>1961: Packet switching</b><br>

Leonard Kleinrock publishes the first paper on packet switching theory at MIT.
MIT (1961-1967), RAND (1962-1965), and NPL (1964-1967) had all developed packet switching in parallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word "packet" was adopted from the work at NPL. Work from this would later create ARPANET which became the global internet. The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is being upgraded from the much less efficient circuit switched network to packet switched and new communications are using the internet protocol, to the point where the PSTN is gradually being replaced by the internet in a slow process that will likely take decades to complete, after all the PSTN has been in place for over 100 years.

According to Datamation magazine, IBM had an 81.2-percent share of the computer market in 1961, the year in which it introduced the 1400 Series. The 1401 mainframe, the first in the series, replaced the vacuum tube with smaller, more reliable transistors and used a magnetic core memory. Demand called for more than 12,000 of the 1401 computers, and the machine's success made a strong case for using general-purpose computers rather than specialized systems.

<p>
The SLAC research program centers on experimental and theoretical research in elementary particle physics using electron beams and a broad program of research in atomic and solid-state physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine using synchrotron radiation.
<p>
The facility is located on 172 hectares (426 acres) of Stanford University-owned land on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California—just west of the University's main campus. The main accelerator is 3.2 kilometers (2 mi) long—the longest linear accelerator in the world—and has been operational since 1966.
<p>
Research at SLAC has produced three Nobel Prizes in Physics:<br>
1976: The charm quark—see J/ψ meson.<br>
1990: Quark structure inside protons and neutrons.<br>
1995: The tau lepton.
<p>
SLAC's meeting facilities also provided a venue for the Homebrew Computer Club and other pioneers of the home computer revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1984 the laboratory was named an ASME National Historic Engineering Landmark and an IEEE Milestone. SLAC developed and, in December 1991, began hosting the first World Wide Web server outside of Europe.

Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), located just outside Batavia, Illinois, near Chicago, is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory specializing in high-energy particle physics. Since 2007, Fermilab has been operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, and the Universities Research Association (URA). Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor.
<br><br>
Fermilab's Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator; at 3.9 miles (6.3 km) in circumference, it was the world's largest particle accelerator until CERN, the discovery of the top quark was announced by researchers who used the Tevatron's CDF and DØ detectors in 1995.
<br><br>
In addition to high-energy collider physics, Fermilab hosts fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MicroBooNE (Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment), NOνA (NuMI Off-Axis νe Appearance) and SeaQuest. Completed neutrino experiments include MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search), MiniBooNE and SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment). The MiniBooNE detector was a 40-foot (12 m) diameter sphere that contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1,520 phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events were recorded each year. SciBooNE sat in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but had fine-grained tracking capabilities. The NOνA experiment uses, and the MINOS experiment used, Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels 455 miles (732 km) through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota and the Ash River, MN site of the NOνA far detector.
<br><br>
Fermilab has been approved and currently stands to become the world leader in Neutrino physics through the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) often shortened to LBNF/DUNE. Fermilab will be the site of LBNF's future beamline, and the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), in Lead, South Dakota, is the site selected to house the massive far detector. The term "baseline" refers to the distance between the neutrino source and the detector. The far detector current design is for four modules of instrumented liquid argon with a fiducial volume of 10 kilotons each. The first two modules are expected to be complete in 2024, with the beam operational in 2026. The final module is planned to be operational in 2027.
<br><br>
LBNF/DUNE plans a world-class program in neutrino physics that will measure fundamental physical parameters to high precision and explore physics beyond the Standard Model. The measurements DUNE will make will greatly increase the physics community's understanding of neutrinos and their role in the universe, thereby better elucidating the nature of matter and anti-matter. It will send the world's highest-intensity neutrino beam to a near detector on the Fermilab site and the far detector 800 miles (1300 km) away at SURF.

Bob Noyce, Gordon Moore leave Fairchild and with Andy Grove form Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, which produced the worlds first commercial microprocessor, and remains a top processor developer to this day. Intel stands for integrated electronics, with the original goal of producing an entire computer on a chip (integrated circuit).
<p>
Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Inc., Lenovo (formerly IBM), Hewlett Packard, Inc. and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.
<p>
Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.
<p>
Intel's Systems Group began in the early 1990s, showcased manufacturing of PC "motherboards", and shortly after, began manufacturing fully configured "white box" systems for the dozens of PC clone companies. At its peak in the mid-1990s, Intel manufactured over 15% of all PCs, making it the third-largest supplier at the time.
<p>
During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, the Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial.
<p>
On September 8, 2008, Intel began shipping its first mainstream solid-state drives, the X18-M and X25-M with 80 GB and 160 GB storage capacities. Reviews measured high performance with these MLC-based drives. Intel released its SLC-based Enterprise X25-E Extreme SSDs on October 15 that same year in capacities of 32GB and 64GB.

<b>1968: self-aligned MOS silicon gate technology</b><br>
In electronics, a self-aligned gate is a transistor manufacturing feature whereby a refractory gate electrode region of a MOSFET transistor is used as a mask for the doping of the source and drain regions. This technique ensures that the gate will slightly overlap the edges of the source and drain, leading to MOS transistors that are faster, smaller and more reliable than transistors made without them. The use of self-aligned gates is one of the many innovations that led to the large increase in computing power in the 1970s. Self-aligned gates are still used in most modern integrated circuit processes.
<p>
 Federico Faggin created the self-aligned MOS silicon gate technology that made possible dynamic memories, non-volatile memories, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. At Fairchild he produced the world's first commercial integrated circuit using Silicon Gate Technology with self aligned MOSFET transistors: the Fairchild 3708.

CP/CMS (Control Program/Cambridge Monitor System) is a discontinued a time-sharing operating system of the late 60s and early 70s, known for its excellent performance and advanced features.It had three distinct versions:
<p>
CP-40/CMS, an important "one-off" research system that established the CP/CMS virtual machine architecture<br>
CP-67/CMS, a reimplementation of CP-40/CMS for the IBM System/360-67, and the primary focus of this article<br>
CP-370/CMS, a reimplementation of CP-67/CMS for the System/370 – never released as such, but became the foundation of IBM's VM/370 operating system, announced in 1972.
<p>
Each implementation was a substantial redesign of its predecessor and an evolutionary step forward. CP-67/CMS was the first widely available virtual machine architecture. IBM pioneered this idea with its research systems M44/44X (which used partial virtualization) and CP-40 (which used full virtualization).
In addition to its role as the predecessor of the VM family, CP/CMS played an important role in the development of operating system (OS) theory, the design of IBM's System/370, the time-sharing industry, and the creation of a self-supporting user community that anticipated today's free software movement.

It was the first commercially available microprocessor by Intel. The chip design started in April 1970, when Federico Faggin joined Intel, and it was completed under his leadership in January 1971. The first commercial sale of the fully operational 4004 occurred in March 1971 to Busicom Corp. of Japan for which it was originally designed and built as a custom chip. 
<p>
In mid-November of the same year, with the prophetic ad "Announcing a new era in integrated electronics", the 4004 was made commercially available to the general market. The 4004 is history’s first monolithic CPU, fully integrated in one small chip. Such a feat of integration was made possible by the use of the then-new silicon gate technology which allowed twice the number of random-logic transistors and an increase in speed by a factor of five compared to the incumbent technology. The 4004 microprocessor is one of 4 chips constituting the MCS-4 chip-set, which includes the 4001 ROM, 4002 RAM, and 4003 Shift Register. With these components, small computers with varying amounts of memory and I/O facilities can be built.

Zilog is an American manufacturer of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. Its most famous product is the Z80 series, 8-bit microprocessors that were compatible with the Intel 8080 but less expensive to use. Both 16- and 32-bit processors were also produced by the company, but these did not see widespread use. From the 1990s the company focused primarily on the microcontroller market. The name is an acronym for "Z (the last word in) integrated logic".
<p>
The Z80(i) was an improved implementation of the Intel 8080 architecture, which was faster, more capable, and much cheaper; alongside the 6502 it was one of the most popular 8-bit processors for general purpose microcomputers and other applications. It was used in the Nintendo Game Boy, Sega Master System, the Sinclair ZX80, ZX81, ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC home computers as well as the MSX architecture and the Microbee and Tandy TRS-80 series—among many others. More so than simply sparking improvements in the budding field of home computing and gaming, the Z-80 also sparked a revolution in electronic music, as the first truly programmable polyphonic synthesizers (as well as their peripherals) relied heavily on implementations of this CPU.
<p>
Many Texas Instruments graphing calculators used the Z80 as the main processor, and the chip found continued use in some game consoles such as the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the United States) as a dedicated sound controller. The CP/M operating system (and its huge software library featuring hits like Wordstar and dBase) was known to be "the Z80 disk operating system", and its success is partly due to the popularity of the Z80.
<p>
After the Z80 Zilog introduced the 16-bit Z8000 and 32-bit Z80000 processors, but these were not particularly successful, and the company refocused on the microcontroller market, producing both basic CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits/standard products (ASICs/ASSPs) built around a CPU core. As well as producing processors, Zilog has produced several other components. One of the most famous was the Zilog SCC serial communications controller as found on early Apple Macintosh, Sun SPARCstations and SPARCservers up to the SPARCstation 20.
<p>
Zilog was started in California in 1974 by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann who both left Intel after working on the 4004 and 8080 microprocessors and custom chips.

Apple I by Steve Wozniak, a single-board computer. Wozniak offers his new computer to Hewlett-Packard, and Jobs offers it to Atari, who both reject it as a non-viable product. With specifications in hand and an order for 100 machines at $500 each from the Byte Shop, Woz and Jobs got their start in business, they incorporate the Apple Computer Company, on April Fool's Day. By July that year, the Apple I computer board is sold in kit form, and delivered to stores for $666.66. 
<p>
The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977 and was a big success that carried the company until it released the Macintosh in 1884. The Mac with a LaserWriter PS printer, and PageMaker software, was a huge success and started the desktop publishing market. It was around this time that Jobs hired John Scully as CEO of Apple, but the two did not work well together. In 1985 Scully did not approve of Jobs research expenses and convinced the board to remove Jobs from Apple. As a result, Apple stopped innovating and their stock started dropping. In 1997, Apple had gotten rid of Scully and hired Jobs back, along with Jobs Next Computing team, which began rebuilding the companies reputation.

Although his career in computing spanned more than two decades, he is mainly remembered in connection with IBM's unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to license CP/M for the IBM PC.

Digital Research (not to be confused with Digital Equipment Corporation) was the first large software company in the microcomputer world. It was based in Pacific Grove, California. DR's product suite included the original CP/M and its various offshoots; DR-DOS which was a MS-DOS compatible version of CP/M, and MP/M, the multi-user CP/M.

<b>1976 June: Dr. Dobbs Journal</b><br>
<table><td>
<img src="pics19601980/1976_ddj.gif"></td><td>
The first issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal magazine is published. Dr. Dobb’s Journal was one of the longest running microcomputer magazines, lasting 33 years in print form. It was first published in January 1976 as Dr. Dobb’s Journal of Computer Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia with the subtitle “Running Light Without Overbyte.” The title of the magazine was eventually shortened to Dr. Dobb’s Journal.
<p>
The name “Dr. Dobb” didn’t refer to a real person but was a combination of the first names of Bob Albrecht and Dennis Allison, the founders of the magazine. Dr. Dobb’s Journal was originally created to promote Tiny BASIC, a small but powerful BASIC interpreter that could be used on the new microcomputers such as the Altair.
<p>
But in a short time, the magazine expanded beyond Tiny BASIC.  DDJ was the first regular periodical focused on microcomputer software, rather than hardware. In its last years of publication, it was distributed as a PDF monthly, although the principal delivery of Dr. Dobb's content was through the magazine's website. Publication ceased at the end of 2014, with the archived website continuing to be available online.
<p>
The newsletter's content was originally pure enthusiast material. Initial interest circled around the Tiny BASIC interpreter, but Warren broadened that to include a variety of other programming topics, as well as a strong consumer bias, especially needed in the chaotic early days of microcomputing. All of the content came from volunteer contributors, with Steve Wozniak as one of the better known of them. Other contributors included Jef Raskin, later credited as a leader in the Macintosh development, and Gary Kildall, who had created CP/M, the first disk operating system for microcomputers which was not married to proprietary hardware.

Computer program source code published during the early years include:<br>
Tiny BASIC interpreter <br>

Novell began as a computer and operating system manufacturer. In January 1983, they introduced NetWare, the first LAN software based on file-server technology, the first multi-platform network operating system (NOS).
<p>
Novell based its network protocol on Xerox Network Systems, created its own standards which it named Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) and Sequenced Packet Exchange (SPX). File and print services ran on the NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) over IPX, as did Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and Service Advertising Protocol (SAP).
<p>
By 1990, Novell had an almost monopolistic position in NOS for any business requiring a network. Stock prices rose above $40 per share. By 1995 Microsoft begins to aggressively compete with Novell. TCP/IP networking was included in Windows 95, and NT enters the server market with Active Directory included to compete with Novell directory services. Novell stock prices would drop below $7 per share.
<p>
Novell then initiates litigation against a large number of Novell resellers who were routinely selling upgrades as newly purchased NetWare versions. Although this move bolstered Novell's revenue numbers for several quarters, Novell's channels subsequently collapsed with the majority of Novell's resellers dropping NetWare for fear of litigation.
<p>
By 1999, Novell had lost its dominant market position, and was continually being out-marketed by Microsoft as Novell's resellers dropped NetWare for fear of litigation. Most resellers then re-certified their Novell CNE employees as Microsoft MSCE technicians. 
<p> 
Novell tries desperately to compete with Microsoft. They buy Microsoft Office competitor WordPerfect, and Quattro Pro from Borland, but sell them a few years later to Corel. They buy UNIX from AT&amp;T in 1993, then sell it to SCO in 1995. 
<p>
By this time Microsoft begins to worry about the new Open Source movement, so Novell buys SuSE Linux and Ximian, a developer of open source Linux applications in 2003. In 2004 Novell sues Microsoft, asserting it had engaged in antitrust violations. Novell's lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by the United States District Court in July 2012 after it concluded that the claims were without merit.

In September 2014, mainframe software company Micro Focus announced it was buying Novell for $1.2 billion.

EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan and Roger Marino (the E and M in EMC), introduced its first 64-kilobyte memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981 and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company.

Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001. Under Ruettgers’ leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems. Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeek's "World's Top 25 Executives"; one of the "Best Chief Executive Officers in America" by Worth magazine; and one of Network World's "25 Most Powerful People in Networking".

In 2001, Joe Tucci was named chief executive officer of EMC. He has been credited with transforming EMC's business model from a focus on high-end storage platforms to a portfolio of platforms, software, and services that enable organizations to deliver IT as a service through cloud computing. Under Tucci's leadership, EMC grew to $21.7 billion in revenues in 2012.

On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector.
